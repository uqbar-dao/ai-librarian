"This post is part of Polyarchy, an independent blog produced by the political reform program at New America, a Washington think tank devoted to developing new ideas and new voices. Imagine you are an otherwise healthy 30-something who starts feeling weird. You are sometimes short of breath. You get migraines. Your feet start to swell a little. But otherwise, everything seems fine. You go to the doctor. The doctor runs some tests. She tells you, It's probably nothing, but these could be signs of a coming heart attack. You push for more certainty, but the doctor tells you she's not sure. The human body is a complex system. You're young and otherwise pretty healthy. There could be plenty of other explanations for what you're feeling. But it is a little worrying. So just to be on the safe side, maybe you should reduce the stress in your life and eat a healthier diet. What would you do? If you're a sensible person, you'd probably err on the side of precaution. Sure, it might be nothing to worry about, and the likelihood of a heart attack in your 30s might be low. But even a low chance is a low chance of something possibly fatal. Why take a chance, especially when the recommendations — less stress, healthier diet — are good for you either way? I offer this parable as a way of thinking about the debate that's emerged over the past two weeks in response to Amanda Taub's New York Times article profiling new findings by Roberto Stefan Foa and Yascha Mounk — findings that raise alarms about the fact that younger people have, over time, become less and less likely to say in surveys that it is ""essential"" to live in a democracy. Rather than share the sense of alarm, however, several critics have jumped on Foa and Mounk for misinterpreting the data and generating unnecessary panic. Political scientist Erik Voeten, for example, argued that their analysis is misleading: ""The article by Mounk and Foa does document some small shifts in opinion on related issues. But these aren't nearly as dramatic as the New York Times graph suggests."" Similarly, Wonkblog's Jeff Guo reanalyzed the data and argued that it is ""far less alarming than it seems."" Foa and Mounk have responded, drawing on more analysis from their forthcoming Journal of Democracy article, which also documents increasing support among young people for ""a strong leader"" and rising support for extremism. Voeten, however, remains unimpressed, and now has more charts here suggesting the shifts are far less significant than Foa and Mounk make them out to be. ""And,"" he argues, ""it's dangerous too to tell the world that people are now ready to accept nondemocratic governance."" For those who want to argue over how to interpret the data, you should follow the hyperlinks above. There are very reasonable points of disagreement. I don't have much to add to that debate here, other than to observe that it's very rare that data is unambiguous about important societal shifts before those shifts actually occur. When the data is unambiguous, it is almost always too late to do anything. The only sure sign of having a heart attack is, well, having a heart attack. Similarly, the only sure sign of a democratic collapse is, well, a democratic collapse. And whatever you think of the data analysis, there is also a mounting series of actual real-world election results that are hard to explain if support for liberal democracy is thriving. In deciding how seriously to take these findings, it's also worth asking what we would do differently if we took Foa and Mounk's findings seriously. How would we collectively respond? And what would be the consequences? For one, we'd probably invest in a lot more civic education, so that the next generation learns the basics of liberal democracy and understands why it's a better system than authoritarian rule. This seems like a good idea regardless. Similarly, we might collectively invest considerable resources in making a strong public case for liberal democracy. We might also try to figure out ways to make our public institutions do more outreach to citizens to make sure they feel engaged in their democracy, and think hard about building up intermediary institutions that help people feel as though their voices are represented and taken seriously. Again, these seem like things we should be doing regardless, like reducing stress or improving the health of our diets. In my heart attack parable, if the doctor had told you that the only way to prevent a future heart attack would be to give up your job and your social life and spend the next year on strict bed rest eating only kale and chia seed salads, you might want to be a little more certain that you really were at high risk for a heart attack. After all, taking the risk seriously would impose a heavy cost on you. Other recent crises offer some examples of cases where key decision-makers did ignore warning signs, because taking those signs seriously would have imposed significant costs on them. For example, in the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, warnings were ignored because the financial industry had staked considerable investments and product lines on the myth that housing values would go up forever. To admit that housing was overvalued and that securitized mortgages were riskier than advertised would have cost investment banks dearly. But eventually, reality caught up with them, and the resulting damage was far worse than it would have been if we had paid attention to the early warning signs. Similarly, many carbon-intensive industries and fossil fuel producers pushed back on findings of climate change because taking those findings seriously would force significant changes in their industries. As a result, these industries funded doubt and uncertainty. The problem has since gotten much worse, and it has become harder to take effective action. The early scientists may have been alarmist. But we'd be in much better shape if we had listened to them. I would be more comforted if I could be certain that Voeten is right and Foa and Mounk are wrong. Maybe there is indeed nothing to worry about. But given the risks, as well as the recent string of election results, I'd rather err on the side of caution. Like the threat of a heart attack, the threat of autocracy or military rule replacing liberal democracy is pretty serious, and very difficult to recover from. I don't want to take a chance. Especially when the preventive medicine consists of things we should probably be doing anyway.",we-should-take-concerns-about-the-health-of-liberal-democracy-seriously.txt,drew.uq
" The Indianapolis Colts made Andrew Luck the highest-paid player in NFL history this offseason with a five-year, $122-million contract with $89 million guaranteed. However, they're already finding that Luck's contract is inhibiting their ability to address weaknesses on other parts of the roster, particularly on defense. On Friday, Colts GM Ryan Grigson, who is under fire for the Colts 1-3 start, said that it's difficult to build up the team's defense with Luck making so much money. According to Keefer, Grigson did point out that the Colts still have young talent they're hoping to develop on defense. However, blaming Luck's contract — which the Colts gave him — for having a weak defense (30th in defensive DVOA) is not accurate. As others have pointed out, last year's Denver Broncos paid Peyton Manning $15 million in base salary while also boasting an elite defense. Luck also takes up $18.4 million against the salary cap this year, less than $1 million more than Manning did a year ago ($17.5 million). Much of this comes from drafting successfully, which the Colts have not done as well as elite teams like the Broncos or the Patriots, for instance. Now, with the Colts handcuffed to Luck's contract, drafting is going to become especially important, as will the use of whatever money they have in free agency. It's certainly possible to build a good defense with a high-paid quarterback, but if the Colts felt that paying Luck such a high sum of money would be difficult, perhaps they should have reconsidered what the final numbers.

"PARIS (Reuters) - Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy published a new memoir on Thursday but was quick to dismiss speculation he might return to politics to rescue his old center-right party, which has shed support since President Emmanuel Macron stormed to power.  Entitled “Passions”, the autobiography documents Sarkozy’s rise to power, while hurling barbs at some of his former allies, including his prime minister Francois Fillon.  During his time in office from 2007-2012, Sarkozy earned the nickname “President Bling-Bling” for his brash style and close association with tycoons and celebrities. While at the Elysee, he met and married former model Carla Bruni.  “Passions” is released as France’s center-right fights for survival two years after President Emmanuel Macron’s election win dynamited the political landscape.  Sarkozy’s old party, Les Republicains, is locked in infighting and struggling to find direction, squeezed by Macron’s centrist party and the far right.  “The book is a political one, it does not announce my return,” Sarkozy told magazine Le Point. “I neither want nor can get involved in a partisan debate. That would sew confusion and division. There is no need for that. It would be misplaced.”  Nonetheless, each new appearance by the last unifying figure of the French right is closely followed - fearfully by those wary of the return of a big-name rival, and hopefully by those who long for Sarkozy’s political reincarnation.  Sarkozy has retired twice from politics: the first time after he lost his re-election bid in 2012. He returned to lead his party in 2014 only to quit again after he failed to win his party’s ticket to run for president in 2017.  Les Republicains are again without a leader after Laurent Wauquiez stepped down following the party’s dismal showing in May’s European election.  Even if Sarkozy were to return to frontline politics, he would struggle to put to one side multiple investigations, including into the financing of his re-election bid.   This month he learnt he must stand trial on charges of corruption and influence peddling in relation to allegations that he offered a judge a promotion in return for information on a parallel investigation.  Sarkozy has denied any wrongdoing.

"BERLIN, June 17 (Reuters) - ECB board member Benoit Coeure said in an interview published on Monday that if the ECB decided cutting rates was the best option, it would have to consider what effect negative rates would have on banks and whether tiering was needed.  A so-called tiered deposit rate would mean banks are exempted in part from paying the ECB’s 0.40 percent annual charge on their excess reserves, boosting their profits as they struggle with an unexpected growth slowdown  “We would have to consider whether a tiering system is needed,” Coeure said in an interview with the Financial Times. “Today the prevailing view in the Governing Council is that it is not, but we also agree that it deserves further reflection.”  Reporting by Michelle Martin

"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities have arrested six members of the country’s military and police forces over the weekend, according to relatives of the detainees and human rights activists, as President Nicolas Maduro seeks to weed out dissent.   Air Force Brigade General Miguel Sisco Mora was arrested Friday afternoon in a parking lot in Guatire, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the capital Caracas, his daughter Stephanie Sisco said. Navy Corvette Captain Rafael Costa was detained on Friday in nearby Guarenas, according to his wife Waleska Perez.  “We demand that the government provide us with information about his whereabouts,” Stephanie Sisco wrote on Twitter on Saturday.   The arrests come nearly two months after a failed uprising against Maduro called by opposition leader Juan Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly who in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency and has called on the armed forces to join his cause.  They also come on the heels of a visit to Venezuela by U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, who on Friday called on Maduro to release prisoners arrested for peacefully protesting. Maduro, whose 2018 re-election has been widely denounced as illegitimate, said he would take the U.N.’s concerns seriously.  Human rights group Penal Forum had previously said that two retired Air Force colonels had been arrested in Caracas on Friday afternoon while two high ranking officials from Venezuela’s CICPC forensic police unit were arrested in Guatire, according to human rights lawyer Tamara Suju.  Neither Venezuela’s Information Ministry nor the Chief Prosecutor’s office responded to requests for comment on the six detentions on Sunday.  According to Penal Forum, some 700 people are detained for political reasons in Venezuela, including about 100 members of the military.   Maduro’s government has denied it holds political prisoners, and frequently accuses the opposition of fomenting violence. Maduro refers to Guaido as a puppet of the United States seeking to oust him in a coup.

"If only every day could be like this. You can’t put your finger on why: Maybe you had just the right amount of sleep. Maybe the stars are somehow aligned in your favor. Whatever the reason, you’re cooking on gas. Hours fly by like minutes, you’re feeling great, and before you know it it’s 5:30 pm and your to-do list is done.  This feeling of ‘flow’ or being ‘in the zone’ is something that most of us have experienced at some point or other—although not as often as we might like. It’s a mental state that elite athletes seem to have at their beck and call. For us mere mortals, though, it hardly ever shows up when we need it. Since the psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi first described the zone (which he called ‘flow’) in 1975, neuroscientists have been trying to figure out what it is and how to make it show up on demand. Yet as they close in on the secrets of the zone, another truth has emerged: What we think of as  the zone is actually one of many mental states that a person can be in, each of which works for a particular kind of thinking. Here’s how to master not just one of them, but several.   The Flow ZoneTo understand when other states might work better, it makes sense to first consider what we know about this, the original ‘zone.' One thing we definitely know is that it feels great: Csíkszentmihályi describes it as the ‘optimal experience’ in which we can achieve true happiness.  One explanation for why it happens—and why it feels so good—is that it represents a perfect match between activity in brain networks involved in attention and the reward circuitry, which process pleasure. When different networks synchronize their activity—like two pendulums swinging in time—it makes the business of thinking run a little more smoothly, which explains why this particular zone feels effortless when you’re in it.  Even Csíkszentmihályi admits, however, that it’s not easy to achieve. “Flow is difficult to maintain for any length of time without at least momentary interruptions,” he wrote—and that was in the 1970s, before smartphones came along and took what was left of our attention span. So how best to get into the flow? One suggestion is that, rather than screwing up your eyes and trying to force yourself to concentrate, it might work better to do the opposite: Take your foot off the mental gas a little.  This finding came out of brain imaging experiments by cognitive neuroscientists Mike Esterman and Joe DeGutis of the Boston Attention and Learning Lab in Massachusetts. They measured activity in the default mode network (DMN) a collection of brain regions that gear up when we are not thinking of anything in particular. They compared this to activity in the dorsal attention network, which keeps us focused on one thing, and watched how the two fluctuated over time when people were asked to do a boring, repetitive task.  Surprisingly, they found that the best way to sustain concentration wasn’t to cut out DMN activity altogether, but to allow it to carry on as a low-level background hum. In real terms, that means keeping your mind on a long leash: letting it wander a little, before gently bringing it back to heel.  ""If you're devoting all of your resources to a task you will likely be fighting your natural tendency to mind wander. This could actually make sustaining attention more effortful and challenging. If you try too hard you ay actually perform worse work over time,"" DeGutis says.  No matter how much you love your work, paying attention for long periods is hard mental work. By relaxing a little, it makes it easier to find the crucial balance of effort and enjoyment that nudges us into the flow. Rather than trying so hard that we set ourselves up to fail, the solution could simply be to stop beating ourselves up. More from Tonic: The Slow ZoneTime doesn’t only fly when you’re in the flow. It also flies when a deadline is heading your way and you haven’t quite hit your stride. If time is running short and the flow feels a million miles away, all is not lost. You still have time to master the slow zone.  For better or worse, strong emotions distract us from the passage of time, giving the illusion that it is zipping past unusually quickly. If it’s too difficult to take the emotion out of the equation (that deadline is coming whether you like it or not), the next best thing is to change the way your brain processes the passage of time, to mentally buy yourself a little more.  It sounds too good to be true, but Marc Wittmann, a psychologist at the Institute for Frontier Areas in Psychology and Mental Health in Freiburg, Germany, and author of  Felt Time, has a couple of suggestions on how it could be done. Wittmann believes that our brains count time by tuning into the rhythms of the body—the regular ticks of our heartbeat, breathing and so on. He calls this ‘body time’ and points to a region of the brain called the insula, which keeps track of our physical and emotional state, as key to this process.  “My idea is that you are attending to yourself, to your bodily self, your mental self and that is how you attend to time,” Wittman says.  In theory, then, if you can change the information that the insula receives, you might be able to control how you perceive time. One thing Wittman suggests is to speed up your bodily signals by exercising. When you stop, the body’s signals will gradually slow down to baseline, slowing your perception of time as it does so.  “Say I go jogging for an hour and then I’m calm down but still feel very active,"" Wittman says. ""I feel that everything is happening much slower because my body is much more activated and I feel myself much more intensely."" Another option is to direct your attention to the here and now, purposefully focusing on the fine details of your surroundings, thoughts or your mental state. A 10-minute mindfulness meditation will help haul your focus back to the here and now and, by slowing your breathing rate, will also slow down your body signals. Both should make time slow to a much more manageable speed. Wittman’s experiments suggest that expert meditators are able to stretch their perception of a moment by 25 percent, which makes all that sitting around seem well worth the investment of time, no matter how little you have to play with.  The 'Zoned Out' ZoneGiven all the effort we spend trying to get into the zone it might seem strange to actively try to stay out of it. But there are some mental skills that work better when you’re just a little bit away with the fairies. Creativity is one of them. Research by Evangelia Chrysikou at the University of Kansas has found that using brain stimulation to temporarily reduce activity in part of the prefrontal cortex (the region of the brain behind the forehead), increased the number of creative uses for everyday objects that people were able to come up with. This works because the job of the prefrontal cortex is to narrow down the possible thoughts and behaviors that are suitable in any given situation. This is a crucial mental shortcut because it vastly reduces the time we need to make decisions about what to do or say next. The downside—at least for our creative juices—is that it also reduces the scope of our ideas, making blue sky thinking that much more difficult.  So ideally, the right zone to come up with new ideas is one in which activity in the prefrontal cortex is dialled down a little—a state known as transient hypofrontality. “It’s about using the right tool for the right task. If you want to look for ideas then hypofrontal zoning out will help you,” Chrysikou says. There is more than one way to reduce activity in the prefrontal cortex. Tiredness works particularly well, so working when you are naturally at your least alert (morning for night owls, late in the day for morning folk and after lunch for just about everybody) is definitely worth a try. A boozy drink does something similar, according to actual studies on drunk students. And if all else fails, sitting in a quiet and/or dark room can’t help but set the mind wandering to who knows where. However you manage it, it’s worth remembering that while mindfulness is all the rage at the moment, when you want to think creatively, mindlessness is a much better tool for the job. Go on, zone out—your brain will thank you. But remember to come back into the room at some point to make sure that your ideas aren't too bonkers. ""To decide which idea works best, prefrontal involvement is necessary,"" Chrysikou says.  The Cramming ZoneThere’s nothing like a deadline to focus the mind. It’s almost what the fight/flight response was designed for: A short burst of adrenaline narrows focus to help you ignore everything except the life-and-death task at hand. The trouble is, if a period of stress goes on too long, or happens too often, the whole system breaks down, focus scatters, and takes your ability to concentrate with it.  This is partly because high doses of stress hormones, particularly noradrenaline, interferes with focus by binding to sites in the prefrontal cortex, stopping it from working effectively. Another job of the prefrontal cortex is to help us resist impulses that aren’t necessarily helpful for our long-term goals, which explains why stress can leave you mainlining down tea and biscuits when you should be doing some work.  So, what to do when you are stressed and distracted but need to focus  now? One option is—strangely—to make whatever you are doing more difficult to concentrate on. According to load theory, the brainchild of psychologist Nilli Lavie at University College London, the brain only has a limited amount of processing power to use on making sense of the world around us. Her experiments have shown that if you add deliberate distractions to what you are trying to concentrate on (flashing images, colorful borders, background noise) it can actually help you focus. This is because processing these distractions uses up the brain’s processing power, leaving no room to process either external distractions—or your own internal excuses.

"China is dismissing unfavorable media reports as fake news because that’s what Trump does  China is dismissing unfavorable media reports as fake news because that’s what Trump does  In his short political career, Donald Trump has made a habit of dismissing unfavorable media reports as “fake news.” Now it seems Beijing is taking a page from his playbook, using the term to attempt to discredit foreign media reports on Thursday that claimed a prominent human rights lawyer was tortured in government custody. Experts told VICE News that Chinese state media’s adoption of the term appears to directly borrow from the U.S. president. Referring to the state-run Xinhua news agency report, Zhang Baohui, a political scientist at Hong Kong’s Lingnan University, said that “Xinhua’s usage of this term should be attributed to Trump.” China is just the latest country to adopt Trump’s favorite buzzword to discredit unfavorable reports; Russia and Iran have also begun using the term to dismiss critical coverage. The term “is obviously spreading among countries,” said Zhang. In his short political career, Donald Trump has made a habit of dismissing unfavorable media reports as “fake news.” Now it seems Beijing is taking a page from his playbook, using the term to attempt to discredit foreign media reports on Thursday that claimed a prominent human rights lawyer was tortured in government custody. Experts told VICE News that Chinese state media’s adoption of the term appears to directly borrow from the U.S. president. Referring to the state-run Xinhua news agency report, Zhang Baohui, a political scientist at Hong Kong’s Lingnan University, said that “Xinhua’s usage of this term should be attributed to Trump.” China is just the latest country to adopt Trump’s favorite buzzword to discredit unfavorable reports; Russia and Iran have also begun using the term to dismiss critical coverage. The term “is obviously spreading among countries,” said Zhang. Xinhua, the mouthpiece for the ruling Communist Party, published an article Thursday describing international media reports on the alleged torture of Chinese attorney Xie Yang as “nothing but cleverly orchestrated lies.” “The stories were essentially fake news,” read the article. Fake news – false online reports presented as legitimate news stories – emerged as an issue during last year’s U.S. presidential election, and the rise of deliberately misleading stories is increasingly proving to be a problem in several other countries. But the term has been gradually debased as it is used more and more by political actors seeking to discredit critical coverage or deflect uncomfortable realities. Trump has been the most high-profile adopter of the term, regularly wielding it as an insult to bash any journalism that paints his administration in an unflattering light. The most recent claim of “fake news” from the Chinese centers around the story of Xie, a 45-year-old attorney who has represented clients in many politically sensitive cases. He was detained in the Chinese province of Hunan in July 2015 at the start of an ongoing crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists, and has yet to be released. Late last year reports emerged, sourced to transcripts of interviews with Xie’s lawyers, alleging that he had been subjected to threats and violence in custody – with the aim of forcing him to confess to political crimes. Xie’s claims were reported by outlets such as the The New York Times – regularly accused by Trump of peddling “fake news” – and The Guardian, which said that while the allegations could not be verified, they were consistent with previously documented abuses in custody. The Xinhua article Thursday reported that an “independent team” set up by officials to investigate the torture reports had interviewed Xie and his fellow inmates and established that the alleged abuses did not happen. It claimed the torture allegations had been cooked up by Jiang Tianyong, another prominent human rights lawyer who has been detained since visiting Xie’s relatives in November, and who it said had encouraged Xie’s wife to publicize the claims. The torture claims were designed “to cater to the tastes of Western institutions and media organizations, and to use public opinion to pressure police and smear the Chinese government,” Xinhua said. Human rights groups say that confessions to political crimes made by detained activists in China are typically made under duress. Experts contacted by VICE News said that while Chinese state media had long accused Western news outlets of bias against China, the use of the term “fake news” was a recent development. “I would argue that their use of this term seems to be influenced by Trump’s use of the term to discredit major Western media outlets,” said Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Amnesty International. According to the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, Xie has been indicted on charges of “inciting subversion of state power,” and “disrupting court order.” Xie’s lawyer, Chen Jiangang, told Reuters Thursday that his client’s account of torture was genuine, saying that Xie had made the same claims to him.",china-is-dismissing-unfavorable-media-reports-as-fake-because-thats-what-trump-does.txt,drew.uq
"Elizabeth Warren is giving people a new reason to pick up their phones when a call comes in from an unknown number: She might be on the line. It’s a way for the Massachusetts Democrat to thank her backers. It’s also a savvy political strategy to highlight and spread her grassroots support. Warren ignited a viral moment over the weekend when she replied to a tweet from comedian Ashley Nicole Black asking whether the 2020 candidate, whose 2020 mantra is that she “has a plan for that,” has a plan for her love life. “DM me and let’s figure this out,” Warren, seemingly out of nowhere, replied. I am deceased. And ready to welcome new love in my life. And then get our new pres elected. #shehasaplan pic.twitter.com/3n44dpnPnJ Warren apparently followed up with a phone call, Black said Monday on Twitter. “Guess who’s crying and shaking and just talked to Elizabeth Warren on the phone?!?!?” she wrote. Black isn’t the only one Warren is calling — she’s making a habit of dialing many of her supporters, and “Elizabeth Warren called me” is turning into a meme. Do a quick scan of Twitter and for months, Warren supporters have been popping up expressing their joy and surprise that they’ve received a call from the senator herself. AM I DEAD. DID I DIE. UPDATE: I JUST TALKED TO ELIZABETH WARREN ON THE PHONE https://t.co/nUqJ5rvVy5 ELIZABETH WARREN CALLED ME AND I MISSED THE CALLSHE LEFT ME A VERY NICE VOICEMAIL, SHE IS THE REAL DEAL This strategy isn’t totally new. In February, Warren announced that she would swear off high-dollar fundraisers and phone calls with wealthy donors during the 2020 Democratic primary. In a Medium post announcing the decision, she said she wanted to make sure “everybody who supports my campaign is treated equally, regardless of how much they can afford to give.” Some critics emerged, arguing that such a maneuver was a risky disarmament against a well-funded Republican machine. Some suggested it might be a way for her to explain lower-than-expected fundraising. The New York Times reported that the decision was controversial even within her campaign. But Warren has stuck with it. What Warren is doing here is pretty straightforward: When a small-dollar donor gives money to her campaign through her website, they’re asked for some basic information, including their name, address, and phone number. That information comes in and her campaign picks out donors for her to call and thank. Her campaign has put out videos of her making the calls, of which it says she has made hundreds. She generally calls in the evenings, though sometimes it’s at other times of the day, and speaks with people for a few minutes. For most candidates, “call time” means calling wealthy donors and asking for money. Not me. I’m spending “call time” thanking small-dollar, grassroots donors who give what they can. Chip in what you can, and you might get a call from me to say thank you. Link in bio. A post shared by Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethwarren) on Apr 29, 2019 at 6:51am PDT What makes this feel more organic and effective is the declarations of the people she’s calling announcing what’s happened and expressing their excitement. A lot of them are doing it on social media, and chances are those people are also telling their family and friends about getting a call from Liz. “It’s guerrilla marketing in a way — the humblebragging from supporters about getting a call feels organic and lends credibility to her claim that she’s prioritizing grassroots supporters. It emphasizes her relatability and down-to-earth nature, and generates viral moments,” Amanda Litman, the co-founder of Run for Something, an organization that supports young candidates running for office, told me. One person wrote a diary post for Daily Kos talking about the Warren call experience. Litman added that beyond the candidate, and sometimes even more so, the best messengers to most voters are their friends and family. “[Warren] is arming folks with personal anecdotes to convince friends and family, and social media lets those moments spread far and wide,” she said. A Democratic strategist working for a rival 2020 Democratic campaign concurred. “It’s super savvy and a clever way of turning the fundraising process, which justifiably seems cold and cynical to most voters, into a way to showcase her authenticity and the grassroots energy behind her campaign,” the strategist said in an email. Idk if y’all heard but Elizabeth Warren called me today to thank me for supporting her campaign and my WHOLE LIFE WAS MADE! @ewarren you are the absolute COOLEST! pic.twitter.com/9ODwffMG9A Oh my god. Elizabeth Warren called me to thank me for donating to her campaign a whole month ago and I just found out I missed her call. I just listened to her voicemail right now. WHYYYY. Please call me back @ewarren! I’m gonna donate again tomorrow OMG. I was in meeting this morning when @ewarren called & left this message to thank me for contributing to her campaign. I'm in shock. Thanks for the call, Senator, and #ImAllIn. #LetsDoThis. #Warren2020. pic.twitter.com/w6ylSZcnCQ Warren’s calls have also gotten others online wondering why they haven’t received a call. And it could be inspiring FOMO and getting others to donate in hopes of hearing from the senator. She called me. It was such a shock! But completely fun and genuine Wait, why hasn't @SenWarren called me yet? I'm a COMPLETE MESS. 13-40s: my crush hasn’t called me 40+: neither my crush nor Elizabeth Warren has called me This is also a way for Warren to remind people about her commitment to steering clear of high-dollar fundraisers and calls to major donors. She has staked much of her career — and her campaign — on casting herself as being on the side of the little guy and up against Wall Street, big money, and corporate interests. She’s hosting “pop-up” meetings where a select group of supporters in certain areas get invited to meet her in small settings. She’s done those events in places such as Denver, Brooklyn and Harlem, and Alabama. Those pop-up gatherings, along with the calls, reiterate her no-big-money point. “It’s definitely cheesy, but in a way that feels true to her and that over the long haul will absolutely pay off,” Litman said. Since announcing her presidential bid, Warren has rolled out a litany of policy proposals on a wide range of issues, including abortion, tech consolidation, agriculture reform, opioids, and the revolving door at the Pentagon. She is outpacing her fellow 2020 contenders in terms of policy. And in calls with supporters, she appears to be reminding them of it. (When supporters don’t pick up, she leaves a message.) And I thought this day couldn't get any better! I had a great convo w/ @ewarren about abortion rights, gerrymandering & the stacking of state legislatures n AL, GA, etc. She LISTENED to me talk about how I feel helpless as a CA voter to help my sisters in other states... On the phone with Elizabeth Warren who called to thank us for our campaign support, AND, we talked a few minutes about child care policy. VERY IMPRESSED WITH HER. pic.twitter.com/Qe6MzKfIhg Jessica Ellis, a Los Angeles-based writer whom Warren called on Monday, told me that Warren thanked her for her support and discussed her proposed wealth tax, which would put a small tax on Americans with a net worth of more than $50 million. She also talked about her student debt plan, which would cancel debt for millions of Americans and invest in debt-free college. (She says she would pay for that with the wealth tax.) “She emphasized that she really, truly believed she could win, and that if she does, she knows she can address our worst problems,” Ellis said. Ellis told Warren she first saw her on The Daily Show in 2009, years before she was elected to the Senate, when Ellis was watching with her mother. “We both said, ‘That woman needs to be president,’” Ellis said. “She laughed and told me to send my mom her best.” update: it wasn’t",elizabeth-warren-called-me-is-turning-into-a-twitter-meme.txt,drew.uq
"(Reuters) - The success of Hudson’s Bay Co Executive Chairman Richard Baker’s $1.3 billion bid to take the department store operator private hinges on whether an independent valuator will view the company more as a retailer and less as a real estate owner, corporate governance experts and analysts said.  Much of Hudson’s Bay’s value is locked up in its real estate. Were the company to sell off some of its properties to raise cash, it could fetch more than what Baker offered, but would then be forced to pay rent to run some of its stores.  Baker’s buyout consortium, which already owns 57% of Hudson’s Bay, has made a C$9.45 per share offer for the remainder of the Canadian company, a 48% premium to where the stock was trading before the announcement.   However, some of the minority shareholders, including hedge fund Land & Buildings Investment Management LLC, say they value the company’s assets at between C$28 and C$33 per share. Hudson’s Bay shares ended trading on Friday at C$9.73, above the C$9.45 offer price, as investors bet on a sweetened bid.  The big valuation gap is due to disagreements over how much of Hudson’s Bay’s prime real estate can be divested while keeping it operational. Selling off property raises cash but also makes it more financially burdensome for the company to rent the space for the stores it operates. As a result, it would likely close stores, and its retail footprint would begin to shrink.  “There is judgment to be exercised on the valuation, which can always be challenging,” said Catherine McCall, the executive director of the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance, an organization representing institutional shareholders in Canadian public companies.  Hudson’s Bay operates 39 stores under its Saks Fifth Avenue brand, 133 stores under its Saks OFF 5th brand, more than 40 stores under the Lord + Taylor banner, 90 Hudson’s Bay department stores, as well as 37 stores in Canada which the company plans to close this year under the Home Outfitters brand.   Hudson’s Bay’s trophy asset is the Saks Fifth Avenue building in Manhattan, which this year completed a $250 million renovation.  Hudson’s Bay’s most recent public estimate for the value of its real estate was in September 2018, when CEO Helena Foulkes pegged it at $28 per share. Baker has offered about a third of that because he argues that the company would have to all but liquidate to achieve all the real estate value.  Toronto-Dominion Bank, which has been hired by a Hudson’s Bay board committee to independently evaluate the take-private deal, will recommend whether the company should accept the offer as fair, or reject it and try to negotiate further.   The board committee excludes representatives of Baker’s buyout consortium and is granted power to prevent any deal, even if the prospective acquirers otherwise control the company. In an illustration of this, a special board committee sank the hopes of Nordstrom Inc’s founding family group last year to take the U.S. department store operator private, after it rejected their $8.4 billion offer.  The methodology Toronto-Dominion Bank uses to value the bid for Hudson’s Bay will be key to the outcome and will be scrutinized heavily by shareholders. The bank will likely be assessing how comparable companies’ shares trade, research similar deals and consider how much a financial buyer like a private equity firm would pay, said Andrey Golubov, a professor of finance at the University of Toronto.  “It’s not done just to justify the offer. That said, valuation is not a science,” Golubov said.   Hudson’s Bay declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Baker’s buyout consortium. Spokespeople for TD Bank did not respond to requests for comment.  Sale lease-back arrangements in which retailers sell their properties and become tenants in their stores have become increasingly popular in the last few years as the downturn in brick-and-mortar retail brought about by the rise of internet shopping has put pressure on retailers to raise cash.  However, some retailers resist them because they view the  rent obligation as burdensome, a stance that often attracts investor criticism. Macy’s Inc for example, another department store operator, was pressured by hedge fund Starboard Value LP three years ago to do more to cash out on its real estate.   Even if Toronto-Dominion Bank blesses an offer from Baker’s consortium and the board committee negotiating a deal approves it, the acquisition still faces some hurdles.  A majority of the shareholders who are not affiliated with the buyout consortium have to vote for it, accounting for about 21.5 percent of the company’s shareholder base. Opponents could still challenge the deal in court when the company seeks approval for it before a judge under the Canada Business Corporations Act.   But successful legal challenges of deals that have followed the process for management buyouts outlined by the Ontario Securities Commission, as Hudson’s Bay is seeking to do, are rare.  “Most of these deals get done once they get board approval and a transaction agreement gets signed,” said Jeremy Fraiberg, chair of the mergers and acquisitions group at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP.

"Nancy Pelosi is getting visions of reclaiming her House gavel. In an interview published by Politico on Thursday, the House minority leader said she is becoming increasingly optimistic that the Democratic Party might take back the House of Representatives in November. They’ll need to flip 30 seats controlled by the Republicans to do so. “I thought in December I would’ve told you we’d win 20 seats, left to our own devices,” Pelosi said in an interview with Politico’s Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. “(But) seeing the behavior of the [GOP] presidential candidates right after that when the debates [happened], I became even more optimistic because they were so pathetic. … Since then, I think anything is possible.” Most observers think Democrats are unlikely to flip the House. But Pelosi suggested a Hillary Clinton landslide might carry House Democrats to power with her. “If Hillary were to win 54-46, oh my God. It’s all over. If it's 53-47, and I think that’s in the realm of possibility ... that’s a big deal,” Pelosi told Politico. “Five or more [percentage points] is a big deal.” Pelosi’s projections might sound optimistic, but they’re not that far outside the mainstream. Last month, I spoke to Geoffrey Skelley, a political analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, who offered a similar theory. Clinton’s lead over Donald Trump has narrowed from late August from 8 points to around 3 points, so a 5-point win seems increasingly unlikely. But if Clinton can somehow reopen her big lead, the House really might be on the table. Here’s why. Get a district to vote for your party’s presidential nominee and your party will also probably win its House seat. That’s not an ironclad rule, but it’s a pretty good indicator — in 2012, only 6 percent of districts that voted for Barack Obama voted a Republican into the House. This is the key to understanding why Skelley thinks a 6-point Clinton win could put the House in play. That kind of national victory would likely mean 50 House districts currently controlled by Republicans would vote for Clinton — therefore suggesting they have a good shot of also going blue at the House level. Of course, a Clinton win in these 50 districts wouldn’t guarantee House Democrats will pick up all of those seats. (Many are held by powerful or longstanding Republican incumbents who are well-funded and enjoy good reputations at home.) But it does mean that Democrats could lose 40 percent of the House races in districts won by Clinton and still take back control of the House. Right now Clinton isn’t projected to win by nearly that much. Averages of all the major polling firms compiled by both RealClearPolitics and the Huffington Post currently put Her lead right around the 3-point mark; she’d need that to come up to where it was after the Democratic convention, which is unlikely but not impossible. ""A 6-point lead would help create the conditions for Clinton to pull the Democrats over the finish line to take the House,"" Skelley says. ""It doesn’t mean they would, of course, but it begins looking really possible."" How does Skelley figure that a 6-point Clinton win would have Democrats winning 50 GOP-controlled House districts? His model begins by assuming that the distribution of the national popular vote margin to the congressional districts will be exactly the same in 2016 as it was in 2012. This may be best illustrated by an example: In 2012, Obama won the popular vote total by 4 percentage points. In Skelley’s model, a 4-point Clinton win would mean she’d also win and lose every congressional district by the exact same amount Obama did. (Of course, this is bound to be wrong in some places — the distribution of Clinton’s vote share certainly won’t be an exact replica of Obama’s. But since there’s no way of knowing exactly how the popular vote will vary by House district from 2012, it’s a useful gauge of what might happen.) This is why a 4-point Clinton win probably wouldn’t flip the House. Obama’s 4-point win over Romney gave him victories in just 28 congressional seats currently controlled by Republicans. That wouldn’t be enough — remember, Democrats need a full 30 to take back the House. But what happens if Clinton expands on Obama’s national vote margin? Since Skelley’s model assumes the national vote share will be evenly distributed, every additional point in the national vote total translates into an additional point for each congressional district. House seats where Democrats tied or lost in 2012 become places where they win at the presidential level in 2016. If Clinton wins by 5 points, according to Skelley, she’d be projected to win in 39 House seats now run by Republicans. That would theoretically put the House in play but would give Democrats very little margin for error. But if she wins by a full 6 points, then 50 seats slide over to the Democratic column — at least at the presidential level, and maybe for the House as well. Now, Skelley isn’t the only close election watcher who is suggesting the House really might be in play. Princeton professor and election guru Sam Wang tried to take another stab at this question by looking at the margin by which Democrats would need to win the popular vote to win the House and then trying to figure out where the popular vote currently appears to be headed. What he found should encourage Democrats. With the exception of just two elections, he found that Democrats have always won back the House when they’ve won the ""two-party vote"" (voting that excludes third parties): Data from mid-August suggested that they’re on track to do just that. Wang looked at results from something called the ""generic ballot"" — it asks voters to pick between the two parties, regardless of candidates — as well as the national presidential polling. ""If the election were held today, House Democratic candidates would win the popular vote by 5 to 8 percent,"" Wang said. ""Judging from the last few cycles, that level of public opinion appears to be right on the edge of being enough to give Democrats control of the House."" Still, many of the current projections don’t have the Democrats riding a massive blue wave. The widely respected Cook Political Report, for instance, thinks the party is only on track to nab an additional 16 seats. The Cook Political Report thinks only 33 seats are vulnerable at all, meaning Democrats would have to win 90 percent of all of the competitive races to pull this off. In late August, Emory professor Alan Abramowitz released a model for predicting House races based on the ""fundamentals"" of the race, including the popularity of the two parties and the number of seats at stake. He found that Democrats only have a 15 percent chance of taking back the House. Similarly, the New York Times’s Nate Cohn argues that there just don’t seem to be enough gettable seats for Democrats. He notes that Democrats’ ability to win back the House in 2006 was made possible by the fact that 21 Republican seats were held in Democratic-leaning districts during that election. There are just nine such seats this year. ""If Democrats are going to retake the House anytime soon, November would probably be their best shot,"" Cohn said in a story last week, ""and as of now it’s not happening."" There’s an elephant-size question hanging over all the analyses of whether a Trump implosion could give Democrats the House: What happens to ""ticket splitting?"" Ticket splitting refers to the voters who back different parties for Congress and the presidency in the same trip to the polls. In 2012, only a record-low 8 percent of voters did so. If that number goes up in 2016 amid a Clinton landslide, it could give congressional Republicans a buffer from a Trump catastrophe. (Current polling suggests Republican congressional candidates are much more popular than Trump, but it’s unclear how many of the party’s typical voters will actually show up on Election Day.) This is why the X-factor of Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson makes these kinds of projections much more difficult. Clinton’s lead over Trump in most polls puts her about 6 points ahead, but that’s in part because of how weak Trump is — she’s normally polling around the 47 or 48 percent mark, and he’s closer to 41 or 42 percent. If Johnson gets in the neighborhood of 5 percent of the national vote, do his supporters vote for congressional Democrats? Or will they vote Republican down ballot — and make Clinton's big national lead less crucial? This is why Skelley thinks Clinton herself probably needs to win more than 50 percent of the vote to pull Democrats over the finish line. If, for instance, she’s just beating Trump by 48 to 42, then congressional Democrats might need Johnson voters to go blue down ballot, which seems unlikely. ""If she’s only winning barely over 50 percent of the vote, I think it’s difficult to say with confidence that she’ll pull a lot of Democrats with her,"" Skelley said. ""I think she needs to really win the popular vote by more than that."" It’s a colossal understatement to say that the stakes are pretty darn high when it comes to control of the House. If Democrats also go on to win the Senate, winning the House would open the doors for a raft of legislative priorities over climate change, immigration, and a range of other long-held blue sky policy goals for the party. So far, most chatter around a Clinton presidency involves big plans like infrastructure reform and new Supreme Court appointments. Sweeping Congress and the presidency would transform those ambitions into a wholly different kind. But there’s another, and perhaps equally important, reason this fight is so crucial: It may be Democrats’ last shot at the House for a very, very long time. New York magazine’s Ed Kilgore explains: If Democrats do fall short of what they need to regain control of the House even as Hillary Clinton becomes president, prospects for further gains in the near term will probably not be good. The party controlling the White House almost always loses House seats in midterms (1998 and 2002 were the rare exceptions), and 2018 would be a third-term midterm for Democrats, making the odds of an anti–White House trend even stronger. Beyond that, Democrats have a well-known midterm turnout problem associated with their heavy reliance on parts of the electorate — notably young people and minorities — that rarely turn out proportionately in nonpresidential elections. As for 2020, it’s worth noting that Democrats gained only eight House seats when President Obama was reelected in 2012. Many Democrats have certainly come to despise Trump over the course of a bitter and long campaign. But if he can blunder his way into giving them control of the House of Representatives far earlier than anyone thought possible, maybe they can come to forgive him.",nancy-pelosi-says-a-clinton-landslide-could-put-the-house-in-play-the-math-backs-her-up.txt,drew.uq
"The nonpartisan director of the federal Office of Government Ethics ripped into President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for his businesses in an unusually public and blisteringly critical speech Wednesday afternoon. Walter Shaub went so far as to say that Trump’s conflicts of interest put democracy at risk, break with decades of tradition, and call into doubt whether Trump’s own patriotism stands up to history. Trump’s plan to step back from his businesses day to day is “meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective,” Shaub said in his remarks at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “Every president in modern times has taken the strong medicine of divestiture,” Shaub said. Trump’s plan “does not comport with the traditions of the presidency over the past 40 years.” The president-elect announced Wednesday morning that he would hand management of the Trump Organization over to his adult sons and the company’s chief financial officer. He promised to insulate himself from his businesses by donating the profits from foreign stays at his hotel to the federal government and limiting the information he received about his profits and losses. Shaub called the structure “perplexing.” Trump will still know where his business interests lie. He made clear that he plans to return to his company after his presidency. Ethics experts have long contended that the only real solution is a blind trust: Trump should sell his properties and allow someone else to invest the proceeds from the sale so that he doesn’t know what he owns. Trump’s lawyer said a blind trust would, essentially, be too difficult and expensive, since it would require Trump to sell large amounts of real estate. “The president is now entering a world of public service,” Shaub said. “He’s going to be asking his own appointees to make sacrifices. He’s going to be asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives in conflicts around the world. So no, I don’t think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be president of the United States of America.” The Office of Government Ethics has hammered out hundreds, if not thousands, of divestiture agreements involving federal officials. They have had to “divest assets, break open trusts, and dissolve businesses,” Shaub said, and taking those steps can be expensive and painful. But, Shaub said, “their basic patriotism usually prevails as they agree to set aside their personal interests to serve their country’s interests.” When officials were reluctant to take the required steps, the ethics office’s demands were backed up by “the unwavering example of presidents who resolved their own conflicts of interest.” Presidents in the past didn’t just set an example for the rest of their administration, Shaub said. They helped the American system of government set an example for the world on avoiding corruption. The Office of Government Ethics is charged with ensuring there are no conflicts of interest. Its employees search through thousands of pages of financial disclosures and reach agreements with would-be Cabinet nominees, as well as lower-level officials, stating the steps they’ll take to make sure their private investments and public duties don’t conflict. It’s a relatively obscure, generally apolitical agency, and Shaub — who was a career public servant in the office before being appointed by President Obama in 2013 to his first five-year term as director — is far from a public figure. His decision to make a public speech criticizing the incoming president-elect was highly unusual. But emails between the Trump transition team and the ethics office showed that Trump has had little regard for the office’s work since he came into office. For 10 days after the election, offers of assistance and guidance on ensuring an ethical transition were rebuffed. Nor did Trump’s lawyers run their plans past Shaub. If they had, he said, he would have told them it was very possible for the president to sell his real estate assets, and that other officials in the past have done so. As for Trump’s other justification — that the president “can’t have a conflict of interest” — that’s nonsense, Shaub said. “A conflict of interest is anything that creates an incentive to put your own interest before the interests of the people you serve,” Shaub said, quoting a Supreme Court decision from 1961 that called conflicts of interest “an evil which endangers the very fabric of democratic society.” If anything, Shaub said, it’s more important for presidents to avoid conflicts of interest: “The potential for corruption only grows with the increase in power.”",the-government-official-in-charge-of-ethics-just-harshly-condemned-trumps-plan.txt,drew.uq
"The threat of government regulation has been looming over Facebook like a dark storm cloud for more than a year now, and it feels like it may finally be starting to rain. Last week, we learned that the FTC is considering slapping Facebook with a reported “record-setting” fine for abusing its users’ data and privacy. This week, two more things happened that make it seem like that cloud will be staying around for a while. The first was an op-ed by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that was published late on Thursday in the Wall Street Journal. Titled “The Facts About Facebook,” the op-ed laid out why Facebook sells ads (“to offer services for free”); why Facebook uses peoples’ personal data to target them with those ads (people “prefer more relevant ads”); and added a friendly reminder that “we don’t sell people’s data.” Zuckerberg also pointed out that Facebook’s free service is great for users because it helps them “stay connected to those they care about and to express themselves,” and it’s also great for small businesses. “Most couldn’t afford to buy TV ads or billboards, but now they have access to tools that only big companies could use before,” he wrote. In other words, Facebook provides an invaluable service to the world, and its advertising business is necessary to keep that going. If you’ve followed Facebook or Zuckerberg at all over the past few years, you’ve probably already heard most of this stuff. So why is Zuckerberg announcing it in a fancy WSJ opinion piece? There are a lot of people who want to regulate Facebook. And regulators, both in the United States and in Europe, probably read the Journal. That likely includes politicians who want to pass laws that would limit Facebook’s ad business, or regulators like those who work at the FTC. Zuckerberg is bringing his argument for why Facebook doesn’t need to be babysat — “we give people complete control” — to a news outlet that should reach the people who might disagree. But while Zuckerberg’s focus in his WSJ piece is on Facebook’s data and advertising business, the New York Times reminded everyone that this isn’t the only kind of regulation Facebook should be concerned about. In a story published Friday, the Times reported that Facebook is planning to combine the technology for all three of its standalone messaging apps: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. That would enable an Instagram user, for example, to send and receive messages to people using WhatsApp, something that isn’t currently possible. Setting aside the technical challenges of connecting different apps with different features — WhatsApp only requires your phone number, for example, while Instagram allows you to have an anonymous account — the move would create one giant Facebook messaging ecosystem. Each of those services has more than a billion users. There are a lot of people who already think Facebook is a monopoly. This move won’t change their opinion. “This is why there should have been far more scrutiny during Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp which now clearly seem like horizontal mergers that should have triggered antitrust scrutiny,” tweeted Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman from California. “Imagine how different the world would be if Facebook had to compete with Instagram and WhatsApp. That would have encouraged real competition that would have promoted privacy and benefited consumers.” Could the FTC try and break up Facebook? It certainly feels possible. But as The Verge’s Casey Newton pointed out Friday in his daily newsletter, Facebook may beat them to the punch. “If the Federal Trade Commission ever planned to compel Facebook to spin out WhatsApp and Instagram — a big if, I know — you can imagine the company explaining that there was no longer such a thing as ‘WhatsApp’ or ‘Instagram,’” Newton wrote. Maybe something for Zuckerberg to explain in his next op-ed.

Now, in a partnership with security firm Palo Alto Networks, they'll be able to earn badges in cybersecurity, too.

""At Girl Scouts of the USA, we recognize that in our increasingly tech-driven world, future generations must possess the skills to navigate the complexities and inherent challenges of the cyber realm,"" Girl Scouts CEO Sylvia Acevedo said in a press release.

I’ll be thinking of those too. I’ll also be thinking of a moment that I feel like I’m watching for the first time every time I see it. A little girl and boy stand on the edge of a street, alone together. Their cheeks, once pale and white, now resemble the inside of a grapefruit. The boy, nervous yet determined, asks whether she prefers her days sunny or cloudy. Her answer excites the boy. They trade smiles and then he runs off. Overjoyed, he tosses a baseball in the air. The girl runs in the opposite direction; with nothing to throw, she climbs an invisible set of stairs and then launches herself skyward. The scene is in Isao Takahata’s 1991 masterpiece Only Yesterday, which screened at the French Institute Alliance Française’s Animation First film festival on January 26th, handpicked by this year’s guest of honor, Kirikou and The Sorceress director Michel Ocelot. Ocelot selected the film in part because it is one of his favorite films by Takahata, but the screening also honors the life and career of Takahata, who passed away in April 2018. Only Yesterday follows Takeo, a single woman in her late 20s, living and working in Tokyo, where she has spent her entire life. Taking a vacation from her office job and Tokyo itself, she heads to northern Japan to assist her brother-in-law in harvesting safflowers. On her journey to the countryside, she thinks back to her childhood, specifically when she was 10 years old. She thinks of her friends, her family, and her struggles with both, along with the most evil of all school subjects: math. Carrying around her fifth-grade self, Takeo ponders about her current situation, and she wonders if she let that down that spunky and ambitious 10-year-old girl. Takahata shifts between the two timelines, each one with its own unique look. In the present, the animation is sharper, more detailed, more … present. When the story shifts to the past, the animation is simpler, washed out, the edges of the frame seemingly fading away. These segments are made to resemble memories, dissolving moments in time. When the film released in 1991, it was an outlier, because it told what is still an unconventional story when it comes to feature-length animation. Only Yesterday is about an adult woman making adult decisions, something much bigger and scarier than any energy ball thrown at Goku. The festival featured the English dub, produced by GKIDS and released in 2016, with Daisy Ridley as Takeo and Dev Patel as Toshino, an organic farmer who develops feelings for Takeo. Their performances are filled with warmth and charm, successfully selling the chemistry the two develop upon their first meeting. Before GKIDS obtained the US distribution rights to the Ghibli library from Disney, it was difficult to see Only Yesterday at home through legitimate means, let alone on the big screen. Before 2016, this film was considered the “lost” Ghibli film. Today, and hopefully for a long time to come, it will be seen for what it actually is, a masterpiece crafted by a master of the form.",an-animated-masterpiece-by-the-unsung-cofounder-of-studio-ghibli.txt,drew.uq
"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told NATO allies in a closed-door meeting on Thursday that governments needed to raise spending to 2 percent of economic output by January next year or the United States would go its own way, two people familiar with the discussions told Reuters.  The ultimatum was delivered in a session at the NATO summit, the sources said. “He said they must raise spending by January 2019 or the United States would go it alone,” one person said.  However, he did not directly threaten to withdraw formally from NATO, the people said.

"PARADISE, CALIFORNIA — Brook Jenkins moved to the town of Paradise to escape a rough neighborhood in nearby Chico and raise her three children in an idyllic small town, filled with trees. Paradise isn’t next to a forest; it’s in a forest. Trees run between houses like gargantuan picket fences. “It was peaceful up there,” Jenkins said. “It was beautiful.” Yet those elegant towering Gray pines, cottonwoods, and walnut trees that drew people to Paradise also posed an immense risk of catching on fire. Six years of drought, including the driest period in California history, collided with bark beetle infestations that started spreading in rapidly in 2010, killing off scores of the state’s iconic giants. There are now more than 129 million dead trees in California sprinkled through forests like the one in Paradise, ready to burn like matchsticks. And with more people living closer to this dry timber, the likelihood that someone, or something, will spark a fire has grown steadily higher. Residents lived uneasily for years knowing that a massive conflagration was possible. Some even recalled seeing flames inch perilously close to the town in years past. “We prepared for it, but we never thought it was going to happen,” Jenkins said. When the Camp Fire, named after Camp Creek Road where the blaze began, tore through the town on November 8, it filled the quiet streets with cacophony. The flames roared, tree trunks burst, and propane tanks exploded as the fire swiftly gained ground. By the time the fire passed, almost all of Paradise, once home to 26,000 people, was obliterated. Around Butte County, upward of 52,000 people have been forced to evacuate due to the Camp Fire. The vast blaze has already made its mark as the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history, having killed at least 77 people, left 993 missing, and burned through 10,360 residences and 150,000 acres. People in nearby towns saw the fire risks too, and grew concerned that they were getting worse as seasons got warmer and drier in recent years. “You have an instinct that something is not right,” said Theresa Squires, who fled with her dog Carob from Magalia, a town of 11,000 people in the path of the fire. “It doesn’t feel normal and hasn’t for a long time.” She recalled being unnerved when she first visited Magalia in 2011 and saw so many dry pine trees so close to homes. “I was just saying the day before [the Camp Fire] that this is a scary situation to be in, and lo and behold,” Squires said. It’s tempting to treat the Camp Fire as an anomaly, a one-off, worst-case scenario disaster. As Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Twitter after visiting the area this week, “Every time I come to California I say this is the worst fire I’ve seen. Once again this is the absolute worst. Worse than any war zone I saw in Iraq.” The fact is, climate and forest science tells us that massive wildfires like this are likely to become more destructive as average temperatures rise and populations grow, putting people and fuel into closer contact. We can do many things to reduce these risks. However, the Camp Fire is a stark vision of a future where we do nothing. I drove to Paradise on Thursday, venturing into ever thicker and more ominous smoke that shrouded the highway. When I arrived, I was struck that there was scarcely any sound at all, not even from leaves rustling. Bits of ash flurries drifted from charred tree branches. Dust coated every surface. Pockets in the ground were still smoldering and billowing smoke. The carcasses of cars, paint scorched off and tires melted, were scattered along the streets. The homes in Paradise are now almost all flattened save for their brick chimneys stubbornly standing firm. Only a handful of people were on my street, mainly searchers in white Tyvek suits, prodding among the wreckage aided by cadaver dogs. They are combing house by burned-out house for human remains. The swift winds that at one point advanced the flames at a rate of one football field per second have now died down. Firefighters have taken advantage of the lull to cut firebreaks in dry forests and pile up soil to control the blaze. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reports that the Camp Fire is 45 percent contained and expects to reach 100 percent by the end of the month. But even a week after the fire passed, the panicked early moments when the flames roared in remain vivid for Paradise residents like Jenkins. On the morning of November 8, Jenkins watched as the sky turned orange, and embers and ash fluttered around her house in Paradise. She rushed to get back to the elementary school where she had just dropped off two of her children. By the time she returned home, the Camp Fire had spread around her house. “Within 30 minutes altogether, it was surrounding us,” Jenkins said. “We didn’t have time to get anything.” She and her husband piled their three children, their relatives who lived with them, and all their dogs and cats into three cars and started heading away from the flames and toward Chico, about 20 miles away. The journey took more than three hours, the narrow highways choked with people like her fleeing the roaring fire. Trees ignited and fell along the roads. Traffic stopped. Jenkins was separated from her children, who were riding in a different car with relatives further behind. With cars at a standstill and the fire encroaching, Jenkins left her car to gather her stranded children on foot. When she returned to her car, she saw flames inching toward her back bumper. She said she’s grateful to be alive and wants all her friends and family to know she, her husband, her brother, her sister, and her mother-in-law, and her three children are safe. For now, she is now staying with her family in a motel in Red Bluff, about 40 miles northwest of Chico. But the home and the life she built in Paradise is gone. What’s next is uncertain. “I just don’t know where we’re going to go, what we’re going to do,” she said. Some of the people fleeing the flames found shelter with friends and family. Others are staying in evacuation centers in the nearby city of Chico. And others still are sleeping in their cars or camping in tent cities that have organically emerged in the miasma of the inferno. Down in Chico, the city of roses, the air smells dry, dusty, and oddly sweet. The smoke has bathed the city in a sunset glow even in the middle of the afternoon. Local children ride Razor scooters wearing N95 respirators. A makeshift bazaar has taken root on the edge of a Chico Walmart parking lot where volunteers distribute food, clothing, respirators, and toiletries to what’s become a de facto refugee camp. Dozens of people have camped out in their cars while others have pitched tents on the grass shoulder. The site emerged organically, but that’s also led to some frustration, according to Guido Barbero, a Chico resident who is coordinating volunteers at the site. Various city officials and local law enforcement have promised more formal leadership and another site to shelter evacuees. However, in the week since the Camp Fire ignited, the Walmart camp has only grown. Now they have word that they must clear out the site by Tuesday. Where the evacuees will go remains uncertain. “It’s really the lack of information” that’s hampering relief, Barbero said. At the same time, the ingredients for an unprecedented fire have been brewing for years, so better planning and coordination for a relief effort should have been in place to deal with the fallout. “This was going to happen sooner or later,” Barbero said. “This was not a surprise to us.” While the campsite has been overwhelmed by donations of clothes, food, and supplies, some of the evacuees are growing concerned about health issues. Over the din of portable generators, coughing echoes throughout the camp as the omnipresent wildfire smoke in the air exacerbates health issues like asthma. The air quality here is some of the worst in the world, earning a rating of “hazardous.” Other residents complained about theft and poor sanitation. Temperatures are also dropping as the city heads further into winter. The strip of dried grass where people have pitched their tents is prone to flooding, and rain is expected next week. Some health issues are also emerging in some of the formal evacuation sites. One shelter in Chico reported a norovirus outbreak. Meanwhile, across town at Bidwell Junior High School, Red Cross volunteers are moving cots into a gymnasium to give the 65 evacuees there more space. Katherine Grochowski, the shelter supervisor, said the site also has too many donations of food and clothing. “Cash is the best thing to give,” she said. Grochowski, who has been working in relief efforts for 19 years, said the recent spate of fires and storms across the United States “seems like one disaster after another” but added that relief organizations are getting plenty of firsthand experience, helping them get better at responding to calamities. But on the question of whether people afflicted by a disaster should relocate or rebuild, Grochowski choked up and recalled her own brush with disaster, a tornado that struck her hometown of Owensboro, Kentucky. Some people moved away, but others were adamant about restoring what they lost in the storm, an attitude she found inspiring. People all over the world have a sense of place and belonging with their homes, no matter the risks, according to Grochowski. And she couldn’t imagine moving away herself after a disaster. Chico city manager Mark Orme agreed. “The optimal solution here is to get people back home as soon as possible,” he said. Even though the climate is changing — warming up the air, drying out the trees, and increasing the severity of droughts, thereby fueling massive fires— Orme believes that it is possible to prepare for these risks. That can range from fireproof construction to strategically removing fire-prone trees. But he acknowledged that it’s hard to prepare for an unprecedented disaster like the Camp Fire, and rebuilding to mitigate the next wildfire will take towns like Paradise, Magalia, and Concow into uncharted territory with untested solutions. “You obviously never expect the largest of disasters in State of California history to happen on your doorstep,” he said. Right now, the City of Chico is trying to restore a sense of normalcy for evacuees. Chico officials even hosted a town council meeting for Paradise officials, allowing them to use the chambers to discuss the minutiae of running a city, with the added challenge that most of the city is gone. “I was amazed at the pride and passion of that community,” Orme said.",paradise-california-wildfire-why-the-fire-threat-to-california-is-only-growing.txt,drew.uq
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) will pay $575 million to settle claims made by U.S. states, the latest settlement as the bank works to resolve lingering investigations and legal battles stemming from its sales-practices scandal and to remove a punitive asset cap.    Two years ago, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $190 million to settle federal government claims that the bank created phony customer accounts. Since then, the bank has racked up over $2 billion in penalties as other issues were discovered across most of its business lines.   Friday’s settlement resolves claims by all 50 states and the District of Columbia related to the accounts, as well as claims that the bank improperly referred and charged customers for a number of financial products like auto and life insurance.     “Instead of safeguarding its customers Wells Fargo exploited them,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “This is an incredible breach of trust that threatens not only the customer who depended on Wells Fargo, but confidence in our banking system.”   The settlement, confirmed by Wells Fargo and the offices of various state attorneys general, was first reported earlier by Reuters.  Wells Fargo has been seeking a fresh start after revelations that its employees opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts tangled the nation’s fourth-largest bank in fierce investor and regulatory scrutiny for the past two years.  Over the summer, Wells Fargo launched a marketing campaign saying the bank had been “re-established” this year, but Wells Fargo continued to attract fresh headlines about the customer abuses of the past.  The bank has been working to resolve ongoing investigations and legal battles as it tries to gain approval from the Federal Reserve to lift its cap on assets.   This year, the bank has settled claims with the New York attorney general, a class of investors and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, but the bank still has a number of probes looming over its bottom line. Wells Fargo still faces probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor, according to its most recent securities filing.

"(Reuters) - Major automakers have announced a slew of investments in the United States since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017 and exerted pressure on the industry to create more U.S. jobs.  China is also attracting much investment, with companies keen to increase their share of the world’s largest car market and keep up with the country’s push toward electric vehicles.  Following are summaries of investments and restructuring efforts made by major automakers in the United States and China since 2017. Some did not respond to requests for information or only provided details for one country.  Toyota Motor Corp has pledged to invest almost $13 billion in the United States between 2017 and 2021 to boost manufacturing capacity and jobs. This includes $1.6 billion for a vehicle assembly plant in Alabama jointly run with Mazda Motor Corp and $238 million in manufacturing capacity in Kentucky to assemble 112,000 gasoline-electric hybrid models a year. Toyota’s Kentucky plant has also gained $1.3 billion in investment to boost its competitiveness.  FCA in January 2017 said it would invest $1 billion in truck and SUV manufacturing facilities in Michigan and Ohio, creating 2,000 U.S. jobs. It described the plan as a move to solidify the United States as its global manufacturing hub for Jeep products. In February this year, it announced additional investment of $4.5 billion in production facilities in Michigan, to produce more SUVs and trucks and create nearly 6,500 jobs.   General Motors Co in November 2018 announced a sweeping restructuring program that aims to cut production of slow-selling models and slash its North American workforce so resources can be shifted to electric and autonomous vehicles. GM put four U.S. factories and one Canadian plant on notice for potential closure. It noted in late April that it has invested $4.3 billion in U.S. manufacturing operations since 2017.    Ford Motor Co in 2017 said it would invest $2.95 billion in manufacturing facilities in Kentucky and Michigan. Those plans included $900 million for its Kentucky truck plant to secure 1,000 hourly jobs and produce the redesigned Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs. This year, Ford said it will invest an additional $1.2 billion in manufacturing facilities in Michigan and Illinois to expand production capacity and add new jobs.  In 2017, Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and parts suppliers, said it planned to lift U.S. investment by 50% over five years to $3.1 billion. An executive said at that time the group was considering a new U.S. factory to build high-margin, high-demand models such as a U.S.-specific sport utility vehicle and a Genesis premium vehicle.  In January this year, Volkswagen AG said it planned to invest $800 million to build what it called a new generation of electric vehicles at its Chattanooga plant in Tennessee. The first electric car from the plant is slated to roll off the production line in 2022.  Honda Motor Co said in 2017 it would invest a combined $352 million in manufacturing facilities located in Alabama and Ohio that would support production of the redesigned Accord car and create jobs. It also said it would spend $124 million on an advanced wind tunnel facility in Ohio.  Although not formally announced, the Japanese automaker has confirmed information from sources that is investing in capacity in Tianjin and Guangzhou to produce 240,000 more vehicles annually. The size of the investment is not known.  The company’s China unit did not respond to a Reuters request for information.  No major additional investment in China manufacturing capacity since the Detroit automaker announced it had earmarked $12 billion to expand production between 2014 and 2017.  Ford said in 2017 it would invest in its joint-venture manufacturing facilities in China to support production of five vehicles, including a Lincoln premium SUV and the company’s first global all-electric small SUV. The investment amount was not disclosed.  In 2018, Ford said it would invest in joint-venture manufacturing facilities in Chongqing to produce vehicles including the redesigned Escort and Focus models. It also said it would be investing to assemble the redesigned Explorer SUV but did not disclose where it will be made.  This year the U.S. automaker announced plans to produce three Lincoln models in China by 2021, instead of bringing in those models from North America.  Hit by a downturn in sales, Hyundai said in April it was suspending production at one of its five plants in China. Kia is also looking at suspending production at a China plant, a source familiar with the matter has said.  Volkswagen Group in 2018 opened three factories – in Qingdao, Foshan and Tianjin – to produce more SUVs and electric cars as well as other vehicles. The German group, which produces and sells vehicles in China through its Volkswagen, Audi and Skoda brands, also broke ground for its electric-car factory in Shanghai, which will start e-car production in 2020.  Through 2022, Volkswagen Group and its joint-venture partners will invest around 15 billion euros in e-mobility, autonomous driving and other areas. This includes R&D spending on new technologies. In June 2017, it announced a 50-50 joint venture with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co, its third partnership with a Chinese automaker, to design, produce and market electric cars.  Honda’s joint venture with Dongfeng Motor Group in December 2016 announced it would build a 3 billion yuan ($435 million) assembly plant in Wuhan capable of producing 120,000 vehicles a year. The plant opened in April this year.

"A six-hour riot that started with a fire and devolved into a rampage through a youth ""super jail"" in British Columbia this week has confirmed long-held fears over what would happen when the province closed down other prisons and consolidated the inmates — some from rival gangs — into one place. It was Tuesday evening when a group of teen boys gathered together inside the youth jail in Burnaby and lit a fire by heating up a piece of paper in the toaster. The mayhem escalated quickly from there, with the kids, who used masks to hide their identities from the security cameras, smashing windows and furniture, fashioning weapons out of table legs, and barricading doors. They destroyed the microwaves and dishwasher, and broke the sprinklers. After they ruined one room and started a flood, they rammed their way into another and continued their rampage. By 2:30 am, officers with the federal police force and 19 firefighters had arrived and the situation was contained. Somehow no one was seriously injured, although there was immense damage to the facility. An outbreak of violence of this kind in prisons is rare in Canada, and even less so in youth jails. But correctional workers and youth advocates have, for years, warned that something like this would happen in Burnaby as the BC provincial government closed down the youth jail in the capital of Victoria and started pooling inmates from all over the province to save money. Inevitably, rival gang members came under one roof. This new ""super-jail"" has become a hotbed for violence and acts of aggression. A six-hour riot that started with a fire and devolved into a rampage through a youth ""super jail"" in British Columbia this week has confirmed long-held fears over what would happen when the province closed down other prisons and consolidated the inmates — some from rival gangs — into one place. It was Tuesday evening when a group of teen boys gathered together inside the youth jail in Burnaby and lit a fire by heating up a piece of paper in the toaster. The mayhem escalated quickly from there, with the kids, who used masks to hide their identities from the security cameras, smashing windows and furniture, fashioning weapons out of table legs, and barricading doors.

Somehow no one was seriously injured, although there was immense damage to the facility. An outbreak of violence of this kind in prisons is rare in Canada, and even less so in youth jails. But correctional workers and youth advocates have, for years, warned that something like this would happen in Burnaby as the BC provincial government closed down the youth jail in the capital of Victoria and started pooling inmates from all over the province to save money. Inevitably, rival gang members came under one roof. This new ""super-jail"" has become a hotbed for violence and acts of aggression. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, BC's representative for children and youth, told VICE News she has been calling on the province to immediately reopen other youth jails to ease tensions at the Burnaby Youth Custody Center. It's believed that the group of young men involved in the riots were associated with the rival gangs from Surrey and Prince George, but further details haven't been made public. Turpel-Lafond says the incident has all the hallmarks of gang-related violence. ""My eye will be strongly fixed on what's going on with the young people and whether this is a pattern, and what's going to be done to prevent this from happening again,"" she said. The Burnaby jail was already grappling with rampant violence. Over the last five years, assaults among the young inmates has doubled, even though fewer people were being held there. Last November, a teen in the jail launched a lawsuit against the province alleging that he was kept in solitary confinement, and accuses the guards of negligence and false imprisonment. Burnaby Youth Custody Services Centre (Photo via Government of BC) Turpel-Lafond added that, before the other jails were shuttered, it was possible to send young offenders to facilities where they would least likely experience violence. This is of great concern when many of the inmates are affiliated with one of the province's gangs. ""If we knew a young person or their parent ran a street-level gang here, or if they were going to be a target by virtue of who they were, care was taken to decide on where they should be located. Now, we don't have those options,"" she said. Dean Purdy, the head of correctional and sheriff services for the BC Government Employees Union, said in an interview that there has also been a spike in violence against the guards who work there. Right before the riot broke out, he says the staff there could sense something was about to happen, so they hid in the secure office. Riot at Burnaby youth detention centre causes extensive damage — CBC British Columbia (@cbcnewsbc)July 21, 2016 ""There have been several assaults on correctional officers over the last few months, and all the anecdotal info from our staff is that tensions are very high inside. It's getting very difficult to manage the inmates,"" Purdy said. ""And there's very little repercussions when inmates exhibit poor behavior."" Staff Sergeant Lindsey Houghton, with the provincial anti-gang unit, told The Province on Wednesday that the force has been looking into gang activity in youth jails for many years. ""This is nothing new and people should not be surprised at it,"" said Houghton, who added that the notorious Red Scorpions gang — responsible for one of the province's worst gang-related murders in 2007 — was founded in the Burnaby jail. However, the head of programs for the Burnaby youth jail put out a statement on Thursday that said the closure of the Victoria jail was not to blame for the riot and that the impetus for the incident was ""a room search earlier in the day, which resulted in a loss of privileges."" Purdy added that the inmates responsible for the violence have been separated from the general prison population, and an internal investigation is pending. Earlier this year, BC's premier announced $23 million in new funding to fight the gang wars in Surrey, which is plagued with frequent shootings and kids as young as 12 joining the drug trade.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s financial services industry has emerged largely unscathed so far from the build-up to Brexit, with about 2,000 roles expected to have moved or been created overseas even as the risk of a disorderly exit grows, a new Reuters survey showed.  Many bankers and politicians predicted Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum would prompt a mass exodus of jobs and business and deal a crippling blow to London’s position in global finance.  But the number of jobs UK-based financial institutions say they actually expect to shift overseas has fallen steeply from the 5,766 predicted to move in the event of a no-deal Brexit in the last survey in September. This new estimate is about a fifth of the 10,000 flagged in the first survey in September 2017.   A no-deal Brexit would mean Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement on trade. Currently, the UK is on track for such a scenario because a deal giving London and Brussels a 21-month transition period to negotiate a trading relationship is at risk of collapse.   Most bankers, however, are confident a compromise will be hammered out. They are waiting to see what will be agreed and what the relationship will be, before making any final decisions about relocations.  The survey results are based on answers from 132 of the biggest or most internationally-focused banks, insurers, asset managers, private equity firms and exchanges to a survey conducted between Jan. 3 and Jan. 28. The jobs are equivalent to 0.5 percent of the 400,000 people who work in financial services in London.  Meanwhile, top investment banks plan to hire far more people in London than anywhere else in Europe, indicating they expect Britain will remain their main regional hub, at least in the short term, a separate Reuters survey showed.  “It will be a slow burn. We won’t know what the full impact will look like for at least 10 years,” said Catherine McGuinness, the de facto political leader of the municipal body that helps to run London’s financial district, known as the City.   “But the City is always changing and it will find a way to thrive.”  Bankers’ sanguine outlook comes even as the United Kingdom is on course to leave the EU in 52 days without a divorce deal, a step that could send shockwaves through financial markets.  British lawmakers last week instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal, a move that is fiercely opposed by other members of the bloc, meaning there is likely to be weeks of political brinkmanship.  The survey findings suggest London, which has the largest number of banks and the largest commercial insurance market in the European Union, is likely to remain the region’s center of international finance.   The decision to leave the EU has jolted London’s finance industry, which has been a critical artery for the flow of money around the world for centuries.   Banks and insurers in Britain currently enjoy largely unfettered access to customers across the bloc in most financial activities. Elements long taken for granted, such as the right to buy and sell products in a single market, are suddenly in flux.   Under a worst-case no-deal scenario, consultants Oliver Wyman predicted as many as 75,000 jobs could go, while the London Stock Exchange suggested two years ago that figure could be as high as 232,000.  The future of London as Europe’s financial center is one of the most important outcomes in the Brexit talks because it is Britain’s largest export sector and biggest source of corporate tax revenue.   Large investment banks are expected to have moved about 890 jobs, just under half the number expected by end-March, according to interviews with more than two dozen industry sources.  Bank of America is moving about 200 employees to Paris by the end of February, according to sources. The bank declined to comment.    But many other finance companies are holding off staff moves until the political situation becomes clearer.         HSBC, which has publicly said up to 1,000 jobs could move to Paris, has so far not moved any staff, according to a source at the bank. Royal Bank of Scotland, which said it could move 150 employees to Amsterdam, also has not moved any employees, a source at the bank said.  Under the terms of the current divorce deal, only a basic level of access to the bloc’s markets will be maintained after Brexit, but if Britain decides to leave the EU next month without a trade deal this would mean no transition period to lessen the turmoil.  A senior executive at one U.S. investment bank said they would have to potentially double or triple the number of staff moved overseas if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal.   So far, the executive added, the impact of Brexit had been much less than expected and was less of a concern than the slowing economy in China and political upheaval in the United States.  “It’s a real pain in the arse, but it’s a technical problem, it’s solvable,” the executive said.  Ninety of the companies that responded said they would have to move staff or restructure their businesses because of Brexit, although only 59 specified numbers. The rest said it would have no impact or they were still deciding what to do or they declined to comment.  For the first time since Reuters started surveying City financiers on their job plans, a handful said there was a possibility Brexit might not happen at all because of the lack of agreement within British politics over how an exit can be engineered.   But the companies said they would not reverse the job moves if Britain were to remain in the EU.  “The issue of political risk has become a really significant issue,” McGuinness said. “Even if you turned Brexit back, which I can’t see happening, I think we have damaged our international image and we are going to have to work very hard to regain it.”  Additional reporting by Sinead Cruise and Jonathan Saul in London, Noor Zainab Hussain and Arathy S Nair in Bangalore and Suzanne Barlyn in New York.

"Just over two years ago, Nebraska fired head coach Bo Pelini after a 9-3 season and a season-ending win over rival Iowa, which included an impressive fourth quarter comeback. Delusional in their abilities, the Cornhuskers thought they were better than 9-3, so they fired a coach who had previously brought them to the Big Ten Championship Game and probably would again. The past two years haven't been kind to Nebraska, which has gone 14-10 under new coach Mike Riley and is coming off a 40-10 shellacking to Iowa. The Huskers went 9-3 (!!!), but they didn't beat anyone with a pulse, supposedly the knock on Pelini from the fan base (though it wasn't very true). Meanwhile, as Nebraska prepares for its second-tier bowl game, Bo Pelini—still a very good coach—is headed to the Football Championship Subdivision title game with his new yet hometown team, Youngstown State. They got there with this catch on the last play of the game: With a championship berth wrapped up, what's Pelini's message to Nebraska? We can only guess that it's something along the lines of, ""Fuck you, fans. Fuck all of you."" Yes, Pelini was rough around the edges, which is probably part of why he was fired from Nebraska, in addition to the perennial nine-win seasons. He seemingly never looked happy, and in addition to ""fuck you fans,"" said things like ""they want to fire me, go ahead."" One game, he swung his hat at an official, and afterward he said he was reacting to a ""chickenshit call."" Most coaches will apologize for behavior like that; Pelini simply said the opposing coach was acting worse than him. He even called a meeting with his former players after he was fired in which he called the athletic director ""a total pussy."" Things, uh, haven't changed at Youngstown State. Pelini is who he is, and he's never going to change. He didn't fit in at Nebraska, and that's why a move all the way down to FCS Youngstown State was probably a good thing—he got to go back to his hometown, to a place that appreciated him. He should certainly be more sensitive with his words, but there's no evidence that Pelini is a terrible person of any sort; he's just kind of a hot head. There is evidence, however, that he is a very good football coach, and there are a lot of Power Five teams that could use him right about now. Pelini's coaching acumen has been verified once again this season, and as Nebraska gets set for a mediocre bowl game, Pelini will be playing for a national title. Perhaps in public, Pelini won't say anything about the Huskers' fall and his subsequent rise, but in private, we know what he's saying, while laughing all the way to the title game: ""Fuck you, fans. Fuck all of you.""",nebraska-is-probably-regretting-letting-go-of-football-championship-subdivisionbound-bo-pelini-right-now.txt,drew.uq
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday kickoff of the U.S. holiday shopping season showed the increasing preference for online purchases, as more Americans opted to stay home and use their smartphones while sales and traffic at brick-and-mortar stores declined.  The ongoing shift to online shopping has forced retailers across the country to invest heavily in boosting their e-commerce businesses, and also highlights the impact of early holiday promotions and year-round deals on consumer spending.  The weekend also redefined the importance of Black Friday. For the past few years, Black Friday was believed to be waning in importance, but it is now turning into a day when shoppers do not necessarily flock to stores but spend heavily online.   Bill Park, a partner at Deloitte & Touche LP, said online sales are starting to complement in-store shopping over the weekend, and for shoppers and retailers the two platforms are starting to converge.   This is happening more and more as retailers like Walmart Inc and Amazon.com Inc sell both online and through stores, making winning the transaction more important than where it occurs, retail consultants and analysts said.  Online sales rose more than 23 percent, crossing $6 billion on Black Friday, according to data from Adobe Analytics, which tracks transactions at 80 of the top 100 U.S. retailers. On Thanksgiving, it estimated sales grew 28 percent to $3.7 billion.  Preliminary data from analytics firm RetailNext showed net sales at brick-and-mortar stores fell 4 to 7 percent over the two days, while traffic fell 5 to 9 percent, continuing the trend of recent years. No data was yet available for actual spending in stores.  In 2017, brick-and-mortar sales were down 8.9 percent for the weekend year-over-year, and shopper traffic fell 4.4 percent. In 2016, store sales were down 4.2 percent and traffic was down 4.4 percent, according to RetailNext.  The decrease in store foot traffic is a little greater than it has been in years past, though still within expectations, RetailNext spokesperson Ray Hartjen said.  Data from retail research firm ShopperTrak also showed that visits to stores fell a combined 1 percent during Thanksgiving and Black Friday compared with the same days in 2017.  Brian Field, senior director of advisory services at ShopperTrak, said online sales have eroded traffic from retailers over the years, “but what we have noticed is that the decline is starting to flatten out ... Overall its been consistent with where it’s been over the last few years.”  In 2017, visits to physical stores on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday were down 1.6 percent, according to the firm.     “This decline feels pretty good to me. I think retail is in for a good season,” Field said.  Retail consultants have said spending patterns over the weekend are not as indicative of the entire season as they were a few years ago the tendency now is to spread shopping over November and December.  The National Retail Federation forecast U.S. holiday retail sales in November and December will increase between 4.3 and 4.8 percent over 2017, for a total of $717.45 billion to $720.89 billion. That compares with an average annual increase of 3.9 percent over the past five years.

"PARIS (Reuters) - Libyan eastern commander Khalifa Haftar has ruled out a ceasefire in the battle for Tripoli and accused the United Nations of seeking to partition Libya, according to an interview published by French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche.  Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) began an offensive in early April to take Tripoli from fighters loyal to Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj’s Government of National Accord (GNA) which has the backing of the United Nations.  The LNA, which is allied to a parallel government in the east, has not been able to breach the southern defenses of Tripoli. The fighting has killed at least 510 people, forced 75,000 out of their homes and trapped thousands of migrants in detention centers.   “Of course, the political solution is still the goal. But to get back to politics, we must first finish with militias,” Haftar told the newspaper.    Haftar also said the head of U.N. mission to Libya, Ghassan Salame, was no longer impartial.  “Partition of Libya is maybe what our adversaries want. This is maybe what Ghassan Salame also wants.”  The flare-up in the conflict in Libya - which has been gripped by anarchy since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011 - began in early April, when the LNA advanced on the capital.  Even though France and other Western countries officially back the Libyan government, some have supported Haftar as they see him as a bulwark against Islamist militias in the country.  Macron had asked Haftar in a meeting held in Paris this week to make a public step toward a ceasefire, without much luck, a French official told Reuters.

"The long-awaited Senate health care reform bill drops Thursday, and it will be a front-page story in every newspaper in America. Over the next week, this document will be parsed to death by pundits on both sides. It will trigger countless editorials and, quite possibly, foment public protests. There’s no exaggerating it: This is the biggest legislative event of 2017 so far, inaugurating the final stretch of debate over a law poised to achieve one of the GOP’s dearest priorities: repealing and replacing Obamacare. But even though the effort has been going on for weeks, the bill release Thursday will be the first time much of the media has treated it like an urgent news event. For the past few weeks, Senate Republicans have been drafting the bill in secret. Knowing that they only need their own side’s votes to pass the bill, they have shut out both the Democrats and the American people from the lawmaking process. Now, there will be only be a brief period for bipartisan discussion before a vote next week. Compared to the drawn-out discussion over Obamacare in 2009, this effort to repeal it is as rushed and furtive as it gets. It’s the legislative equivalent of throwing sunglasses on a Hollywood starlet and dashing her past the paparazzi line. And while the debate over Obamacare was a prominent news story for weeks, the process of drafting the bill that Senate Republicans call the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 has successfully flown under the radar. In the past week, many critics have asked why the press has gone along with GOP’s unprecedented opaqueness. But has it really? Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan blamed editors and televisions producers for downplaying the matter. Where was the wall-to-wall coverage on CNN? Where were the bold New York Times headlines? The New Republic’s Brian Beutler argued that the lack of emphasis on health care reform in recent weeks reflects the media’s bias toward newness and action. Reporters, unfortunately, are not accustomed to writing about the absence of action. “By withholding details, [Republicans] limit the range of reportorial inquiry to questions about the process itself,” Beutler writes. “Have you seen the bill yet? No. Will you withhold support for the bill unless it runs through an open process? I am very dismayed about the process.” These are both fair critiques, but the blame doesn’t entirely lie with the media. Sullivan concedes that sites like Politico and the Hill have vigorously covered the matter, and both the Washington Post and the New York Times have written about this topic “almost daily.” Is it their fault that Americans didn’t care or pay attention? As my colleague Jeff Stein reported, even liberals have been hard pressed to gin up outrage over the Senate bill. “We literally don’t have enough information to motivate people,” one activist told him recently. It is easy to rally people around specific, upsetting provisions in a piece of legislation. It’s much more difficult to organize a protest around unprecedented norm-breaking and lack of good faith. This, in part, is the media’s job: to warn the public of problems coming down the pike — and to make sure that people pay attention. But news judgment has become devalued in the Trump era. If editors plastered their front page every day with headlines asking “Where’s the bill?” Fox News pundits would accuse them of partisanship. They’d run the risk of further losing credibility among a large swath of Americans. The danger of living in a time when people choose their own news is that it becomes difficult to mark the evaporation of democratic ideals. The power of the press comes from its ability to motivate public concern, and this may be one of the clearest examples yet of the erosion of the press as an institution. The media has said “this is not normal” a thousand times since Tuesday, but it has been no match for the GOP’s savvy strategy of legislative secrecy.

"(Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted mixed U.S. sales results for June and the second quarter, with demand still fairly strong for SUVs and pickup trucks while passenger car sales continued a long-running decline.  In the pickup truck segment, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s (FCA) (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI) Ram outsold General Motors Co’s (GM.N) Chevrolet Silverado in the second quarter. GM reports sales on a quarterly instead of monthly basis.  The Silverado has long held second place behind Ford Motor Co’s (F.N) F-Series pickup trucks, with Ram often a distant third. But so far in 2019, FCA’s sales of Ram pickups have outpaced Chevy Silverado sales by more than 40,000 vehicles.    FCA, GM and Ford escalated a price war in June over pickup trucks - one of few vehicle market segments offering substantial profits, which matters at a time when overall U.S. new-vehicle sales are expected to fall this year.  High interest rates, plus competition from millions of nearly new, off-lease vehicles have translated into fewer consumers splurging on new cars. After a weak start to the year, sales in the last couple of months have been largely flat versus 2018.   “The market is not as down as it was to start off the year, which says a lot about market stability,” said George Augustaitis, director of industry analysis at CarGurus Inc, an online marketplace for new and used cars. “At this point, a Fed interest rate cut could be the thing that sparks the industry.”  There have been growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, possibly as soon as at the central bank’s next policy meeting at the end of July, although Fed officials last week pushed back on those expectations.   FCA said its sales rose 2% in June, driven by a 56% jump in Ram sales.   “This type of year-over-year growth is likely not sustainable in the short term, however, calendar-year-to-date, our pick-up truck sales are up 28%,” FCA U.S. sales chief Reid Bigland said in a statement. “As a result I do feel that double-digit truck growth is achievable well into the future.”   GM said second-quarter sales fell 1.5%, with strong sport utility vehicle sales offset by poor performance for its pickup trucks. The No. 1 U.S. automaker said sales of trucks would pick up in the third quarter as both its most popular and most affordable versions of the Silverado will hit dealer showrooms.  Ford, which like GM reports sales quarterly, saw its sales fall 4.1% in the second quarter, with retail sales to consumers down more than 8%, according to auto industry data.  Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) reported a 3.5% drop in sales for June, led by falling sedan sales.   In the last few years, Americans have increasingly shunned passenger cars in favor of larger, more comfortable SUVs and pickup trucks.  Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s (7201.T) sales plunged nearly 15%, with huge drops for much of its lineup including the best-selling Rogue SUV. After years of relying on steep discounts to increase U.S. market share, Nissan is trying to pull back so it can sell vehicles more profitably.  Billy Hayes, Nissan’s North American vice president for sales, said many of the automaker’s models will be revamped in the next year or two, which will help lift sales.  Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) on Tuesday reported a 1.5% rise in U.S. sales for June, lifted by strong demand for SUVs and trucks.

"The Republican Party characterizes itself as the party of the Constitution. But on the eve of the vice presidential debate, it decided to attack Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine for carrying out a constitutional duty. The Republican National Committee debuted a TV ad Monday that attacks Kaine for representing convicted criminals as a civil rights lawyer in Richmond (as well as selectively highlighting his record as governor to make him seem more generous with clemency than he actually was). As the ad’s narration puts it, Kaine “constantly protected the worst kinds of people.” Sure he did. Someone had to. The Constitution says so. Attacking Kaine for fulfilling a constitutional duty isn’t just an expression of hypocrisy, though. The ad — and its bungled rollout — are the clearest sign yet that Republicans who’ve embraced criminal justice reform, and tried to move past racially polarizing “tough on crime” politics, have lost the battle for the soul of their party. “Criminals are bad, and Democrats like criminals” is a well-established genre of Republican attack ad. So it’s no surprise that when the Kaine ad was released on Monday, Roll Call, the outlet that obtained “exclusive” right to the ad, billed it as a “Willie Horton–style” attack. But the conventional wisdom on this type of attack has changed — not least because in 2016, many people understand the racial undertones in portraying Democrats as coddling “criminals.” When the GOP tried a similar attack on Kaine during his 2005 race for Virginia governor, as pointed out by Democratic strategist Mo Elleithee (who worked on Kaine’s campaign), not only did it not work, but it also helped turn voters against his opponent. That put the RNC in an awkward position — and made the ad’s rollout (as Politico noticed) seem somewhere between “bungled” and “unintentionally comical.” The RNC and its communications director Sean Spicer both tweeted out the Roll Call article (with apparent pride). Then, as other Republicans recoiled from the suggestion that a “Willie Horton–style attack” was somehow an okay thing to do, the RNC and Spicer deleted the tweets — and Spicer started demanding that Roll Call issue a correction to change the headline he’d tweeted out himself just hours before. In fairness to the RNC, the anti-Kaine attack ad stays away from the racialized images of “scary black men” that the Horton ad (and its descendants) so freely trafficked in. Most of the criminals featured in the Kaine ad are white. But the reason that “law and order” is such a powerful trope to begin with is because of fears of lawless nonwhites — something the Republican Party’s current presidential nominee understands extremely well. It’s sad to see this. For a few years, it looked like the Republican Party — or at least one wing of it — was beginning to figure out a way to talk about the criminal justice system that avoided racial polarization. Reformers at the state level, and senators like Rand Paul and Mike Lee, talked about the need for criminal justice reform as a fiscal, moral, and, yes, constitutional matter. They deserve a lot of credit for putting reform on the national agenda. They’ve helped bring some of their own party’s skeptics on board — and have helped inspire Democrats to move past their own tough-on-crime traditions. Some have even addressed the right to counsel itself: Republican megadonors Charles and David Koch fund scholarships and training for future public defenders. But it looks like Republican reformers have lost the fight within their own party. The anti-Kaine attack ad might not be as racially grotesque as the Willie Horton ad. But its message is arguably even more horrifying. Instead of attacking a particular clemency policy, it attacks the right to counsel itself. The right to counsel is a constitutional guarantee. Period. It’s right there in the Sixth Amendment (emphasis added): In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense. The Supreme Court hasn’t always agreed on the scope of the right to counsel: Only in the mid-20th century did it decide that defendants who couldn’t afford to hire lawyers had the right to public defenders. But the basic fact of it is pretty inviolable. There is no crime so heinous in the US court system that a lawyer is not permitted — even obligated — to speak in its defense. Tim Kaine wasn’t a public defender; he was a civil rights lawyer who often took on appeals for convicted criminals facing the death penalty. (This Newsweek profile of Kaine by Emily Cadei discusses his decision to take on cases like this.) That’s a type of “criminal prosecution.” His clients had the right to counsel. Kaine didn’t have to choose to defend them himself, but someone would end up having to defend them. Kaine decided to be the person who’d fulfill that constitutional duty. And now he’s getting attacked for it. This isn’t the first time that defending “the worst kinds of people” has become a political liability in later life. Earlier this cycle, Hillary Clinton was attacked for representing a rapist early in her own law career. Inevitably, this becomes a factor in judicial appointments themselves. Barack Obama reportedly passed over Judge Jane Kelly of the Eighth Circuit for his latest Supreme Court appointment slot because of the attacks that were already being rolled out against her for representing violent criminals as a public defender. (He went with the centrist, tough-on-crime Merrick Garland instead.) This has real consequences. The Supreme Court hasn’t had a criminal defense lawyer as a member in a quarter-century. Over that time, it’s eroded defendants’ rights — including the right to counsel. Furthermore, when it’s common to attack a politician or judge for once having represented bad people in court, young lawyers who want to be politicians or judges in later life are likely to avoid becoming criminal defenders. They just won’t want to risk it. That deprives defendants of good counsel; it means that politicians and judges don’t understand the criminal justice system from the point of view of the accused; and it makes them all the more likely to demonize lawyers, like Tim Kaine, who choose to step into the role that the Constitution demands. Republican reformers could stop this vicious cycle if they could get their party to stop treating constitutional rights as an election year wedge issue. But as long as the Republican Party, in even-numbered years, attacks people for representing violent criminals in court, it’s not going to be able to pressure its elected officials and its base to support criminal justice reforms in odd-numbered ones. The racial politics of Trumpism are potent, and it’s hard to imagine they’ll be fumigated from the Republican Party even if Trump loses. The criminal justice reform wing of the GOP will be one casualty. The Constitution — or at least the Sixth Amendment — might be another.",the-most-revealing-republican-ad-of-the-election-is-an-attack-ad-against-tim-kaine.txt,drew.uq
"When John Kinsman of the Proud Boys, a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate group, appeared in court for a hearing last week, he looked like an entirely different man. (The Proud Boys deny SPLC’s hate group designation and question the legitimacy of the organization.) During a previous court appearance, on October 19, Kinsman had a scraggly beard, long hair, and wore a T-shirt and overalls. Less than a week later, he was unrecognizable in court in a suit, black-rimmed glasses, short slick hair, and a clean-shaven face. Proud Boys member gets makeover for court appearance https://t.co/qSy0aBc9CN pic.twitter.com/5riGKuESns The striking makeover is likely not a coincidence, but speaks to an understanding by Kinsman’s legal team that appearance is currency in the nation’s courtrooms. The likelihood of conviction and the length of a criminal sentence has been linked to how attractive, modest, or even light-complected defendants look. Amber Baylor, associate professor of law at the Texas A&M University School of Law, discussed earlier this year how it’s both “standard” and “good practice” for defense attorneys to spruce up their clients before a court appearance. She also runs the criminal defense clinic at Texas A&M’s law school. “It’s very common to ask your client to get a haircut if they want to, because you think it might help them in their case,” Baylor told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times in March. “Tell them how they may want to sit ... what direction they want to look in, whether or not they want to trim their beard.” Looking a certain way can alter perceptions about defendants. Kinsman, for instance, belongs to the Proud Boys, an organization that Facebook recently banned; regarding the ban, a spokeswoman for the social media company said in a statement, “Our team continues to study trends in organized hate and hate speech and works with partners to better understand hate organizations as they evolve.” And last year, Jason Kessler, who previously attended Proud Boys meetings, helped to organize the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally in which counter protester Heather Heyer was killed. (The Proud Boys deny any involvement with the rally and further deny that Kessler was ever a member of the group.) Kinsman was in court stemming from charges related to a fight with Antifa protesters in New York City on Oct. 12. His charges included attempted assault, riot, and criminal possession of a weapon. #JohnKinsman of the #ProudBoys was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court late last night on charges of Attempted Gang Assault in the Second Degree (a felony) & various misdemeanor charges.He is being held in jail on $25,000 bail. pic.twitter.com/kJ1nWOh0i7 But the Kinsman in court last week (he’s due back December 6) didn’t resemble the public’s general perception of a violent person. His suit covered up his arm tattoos and his shorter hair, shaven face, and glasses made him look socioeconomically privileged. Although people who harbor far-right views transcend class and educational lines, a perception persists that they are “hillbillies.” And the rise of Trump and the growing racial animus linked to his presidency was famously blamed on the “economic anxiety” of his supporters. (Most Trump voters weren’t poor, though.) Kinsman’s suaver look for his court hearing signals that his defense team potentially gave him a makeover to shoot down the idea that he espouses such views. As it is, the Proud Boys deny that they’re really white supremacists, despite their ties to the far right; the fact that Kinsman is married to a black woman has repeatedly come up on social media and in the press. Proud Boys supporters have used a picture of the couple to shoot down accusations of racism. Kinsman’s black wife, biracial kids, and clean-shaven face could all serve to distract from allegations that he’s a dangerous participant of the far right movement, most recently accused of body slamming, punching and stomping on an Antifa member, according to the New York Post. Kinsman is hardly the first defendant to overhaul his appearance; it’s a common courtroom tactic, particularly in high-profile cases. Jodi Arias, repeatedly portrayed in the press as sexually alluring, appeared in court for the murder of her former boyfriend Travis Alexander with brown hair, glasses, and modest clothing — a complete departure from the blonde-haired and bikini-clad photos of Arias that circulated in the media before the 2013 murder trial, which even Trump weighed in on. The following year, Eric Millerberg, a white supremacist charged with murdering a teen babysitter, got a makeover before appearing in a Utah court. Associated with the racist skinhead movement where members typically shave their heads, Millerberg grew out his hair, shaved his overgrown beard, and got glasses. But for defendants who aren’t involved in high-profile cases or don’t have the funds for a makeover, there’s no opportunity for a full appearance overhaul. This is especially the case with defendants with prominent tattoos. Some of these individuals wear makeup to cover up their body art, but hiring a professional to do so can get expensive, up to $125 daily. And courts don’t always pay the fees associated with tattoos, even if they may prejudice a jury against a defendant. In March, a Texas man named Joseph Tejeda, charged with capital murder, asked the 105th District Court to help him remove or cover up his face tattoos. There have been several other cases in which tattoo removal or cover-up for defendants similarly became an issue. The requests demonstrate the significance of appearance in a courtroom. And while some defendants will be able to transform themselves, as Kinsman has done, those without means will be forced to appear in court in ways that may expose them to jury bias and prevent them from getting a fair trial.

"This post appeared originally on THUMP UK.Let's try an unusual opening gambit: at the weekends, I'm a bit like Cormac McCarthy protagonist, Llewelyn Moss. He's a fictional welder and I'm a real writer, but we're both on the hunt. He's looking for antelope and I'm after the sesh. Out on our own at the dead of night, the pair of us stumble upon the site of a crime. In his case it's a drug deal gone horribly wrong. In my case, it's an amazing club in Manchester that no one seems to know about.  Let me set the scene. I'm a million miles away from the parched Texan borderlands, deep into Shameless territory. I can't see through the fog and there's no one about to guide me. Eventually, somehow, I make my way to a bar, where I find the last man standing. He must be the bartender. I reveal my weapon of choice. He looks panicked, and I wonder if he's trying to plead with me like Moss' victim does. Actually he's just telling me it's a cash-only bar. Out there on the dancefloor, I can feel eyes burning into me. Is it Anton Chigurh? No, it's just a mate of mine, and they'd rather get back to watching Sega Bodega than hear me try and continue the analogy. It collapses, and we're left in a venue named after a very, very different novel—D.M. Thomas' Freudian erotic fantasy, The White Hotel.  The smog I lost myself in—brightly hued and eerily reminiscent of Ann Veronica Janssens' yellowbluepink installation—was pumping out of what can only be described as a smoke machine on steroids. Pretty much everything here at the Salford space is off-balance; from the under-floor bar to the, shall we say, minimal approach to toilet facilities. With just two stalls to go around as many as 300 punters, it's no surprise that promoters like Manchester institution HomoElectric advise male dancers to ""go outside for a wee, festival styleee."" The White Hotel's been garnering a cult following for some time now, and like nearby club Hidden, it still gives the city's Uber drivers a headache. Both clubs turned disused warehouse spaces into venues bringing Konspiracy-era illicitness to a tired Manchester clubbing scene, ravaged by years of gentrification and disputes with local councils over noise. The location is key—the borough is distant from Manchester's densely populated city centre. Salford council also enforce slightly looser licensing laws than other parts of Manchester due to its physical position. Sitting out there in a kind of no-man's land means that just as the Northern Quarter's Stevenson Square turns into a glorified Instagram opportunity, Salford's nightlife is kicking into fifth gear.  Despite both spaces being tucked away down dank alleys, trouble in the surrounding streets is rare. DJ Black Eyes, who throws an annual 12 hour rave at the White Hotel puts this down to the club's proximity to HM Prison Manchester, a high-security male prison better known as Strangeways. ""You'd have to be completely stupid to cause trouble,"" he tells me. That leads to what Jamie Bull of HomoElectric describes as a clubbing environment with ""fewer rules."" Bull's venture, a gritty-but-glam club night that's taken place in some of the city's most iconic lofts, basements, and dilapidated mansions over the last two decades, now divides itself between the two Salford sites. The appeal is simple; they allow for a more relaxed crowd. ""It's the crowd that don't get dressed up to the nines, it's dressed down for dancing, getting sweaty,"" he explains over Skype. ""Being on the outskirts gives you permission to do that."" Christian Wood is another cult Manchester figure with a predilection for nights out in the area. Known to most as Il Bosco, the man behind esteemed imprint Red Laser Records, Wood's played both clubs, and likens what's going on in Salford today to what was going on during the heydays of rave back in 1991/92. ""It takes balls and foresight to open something like The White Hotel or Hidden, and you can tell from the very act of opening there that the vibe is gonna be leftfield and underground,"" he tells me. ""Plus that dystopian walk up to the door offers its own kind of theater which adds to the feel."" Officially opening two years ago now, there's rumors that the genesis of The White Hotel emerged during illegal raves thrown at Strangeway Studios and the Bunker. The Hotel's owner Ben Ward declined to speak to THUMP, sending us in the direction of the venue's managing partner, the novelist Austin Collings. When asked how the spaces manages to stay commercially viable, he is Collings is refreshingly honest. ""You know when venues and people play the not-for-profit card—but we all know it is really because the next time you see these people they're doused in the latest David Beckham fragrance and they're 33 sheets to the wind on Tesco's Finest Brut—well TWH doesn't even pretend it's not for profit. We are purposefully sinking ourselves into debt and destruction."" An admirable business plan, for sure.  While we're not entirely sure that that's the most sustainable approach to business, it is one that the city's promoters certainly appreciate. ""The people that run these venues have got the right attitude,"" Bull says. ""They're fellow clubbers, music lovers themselves. It's done with some heart and some passion."" DJ Black Eyes shares the sentiment: ""Ben (Ward) is one of the most genuine people I know. You can tell he really enjoys owning the place—he'll go round and talk to people, he'll talk to people in the club, he'll talk to the promoters. I've never seen that anywhere else.""  The five-strong team behind Hidden are dedicated to providing a personal touch, too. We meet at their office one afternoon in June, and director Nickos Arnaoutis immediately begins by singing the praises of Mohammed, the club's airport transfer diver. ""Me and Kris (Arnaoutis' brother and a fellow director) used to get lifts home off him after a night out and he'd always be wearing a suit, he'd be well spoken. We needed a driver so I said, 'would you be up for picking DJs up from the airport for us, representing Hidden?' And he goes so far above and beyond that he'll research the artist a week before, see where they've played, see a bit about them, and he'll be like, 'hello sir, how was it in Berlin?' DJs love it."" The venue, which is an ever-growing network of 600-capacity spaces and artist studios has been lovingly cleaned up but retains its industrial feel. Much like The White Hotel, Hidden was a personal and financial sacrifice since opening in August 2015. With a high-risk booking strategy focused on long-term growth, the club's bookers, Jay Smith and Anton Stevens, found things initially tough. ""You just have to grin and bear it because there is an end-point where, because of the value that you're adding to these people, word kind of spreads and people start seeing that you're doing a good thing,"" explains Stevens. ""We could have gone for certain DJs who we knew would have filled the venue but me and Anton stuck to our guns,"" Smith says. They wanted DJs who might not be massive ticket-sellers, but who'd bring a decent crowd to a new space. They were also helped by engineering a deal with Manchester nightlife mammoths the Warehouse Project, an arrangement that might just have saved Hidden being obliterated by the all-mighty promotion outfit. Stevens, who worked at the superclub before joining the Hidden team recalls, ""what we did was from the start tell the Warehouse Project what was happening, which they really respected. In the past you'd have a battle between Warehouse Project and Sankeys but the Warehouse Project have actually opened a few avenues for us."" Salford's illicit spirit isn't consigned to the two clubs, however. ""About two weeks ago I pulled off the most audacious rave Manchester has seen since the early 90s,"" Il Bosco confesses. ""We had to load a canal boat with the sound system and sail it down the canal to Pomona Island. 400 people turned up and four days later it was still going."" What makes this even more extraordinary is that Pomona is situated a stone's throw away from Salford Quays, home to Manchester's Media City, where the BBC, ITV and Salford University all have sites. While Il Bosco's event was lucky to avoid being shut down by overzealous officers of the law, the continued blurring of the lines of legality are, in part at least, down to the council's belief in the positive impact clubs can have on communities. Hidden's venue manager Martin Moffat explains that, ""councils in different cities have different approaches so we are really lucky. Although in Salford they do make you work for it, as long as you show them that you are working with them then they encourage it, which is refreshing."" Before I leave Hidden, the guys are keen to tell me another anecdote. ""Marcellus Pittman literally canceled his flight just to sit drinking one night,"" Moffat starts. ""He was on the phone to his mates in Detroit like Moodymann and stuff, saying, 'guys I've found the sickest venue and you all need to get over here,' and we were like, he's on the phone to Moodymann, is this real, it's like 6 in the morning,"" Smith continues. ""He called it the new Paradise,"" Arnaoutis concludes proudly. Wood is more cautious about hailing Salford a new clubbing mecca. ""The Red Laser crew spent a weekend at Griessmuehle in Berlin,"" he tells me. ""That's fucking crazy unique and shows even though we are heading in the right direction with clubs like Hidden and The White Hotel leading the way we have a long way to go to match the experiences you get in places like Berlin.""  While he's probably right, it feels good a new chapter is Manchester's rich clubbing history is well under way. Let's just hope it hasn't been written by Cormac McCarthy.   There's a few great nights happening at both venues soon. On the 8th of July there's a day and night party kicking off at Hidden. HomoElectric will be back there on the 26th of August too. That same night sees Lost Control's 12 Hours of Rave bash taking place at The White Hotel. Looking further into the future, the Red Laser squad's Manctaloween party's taking over Atama on the 28th of October. Oh, and Il Bosco's  Bridge Theory  12"" is out now. Phew!

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shares in Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc fell by 1.6% after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission disclosed it has opened an investigation into whether the company misled the agency in its failed effort to win approval for a $3.9 billion bid to purchase Tribune Media Co.  In a June 25 letter to Sinclair posted Wednesday on the FCC’s website, the government agency’s media bureau directed Sinclair to answer a series of questions by July 9.  On Thursday, the letter had been removed from the FCC’s website.  The FCC did not explain why the letter had been removed but in a statement Thursday said the “Media Bureau is in the process of resolving an outstanding issue regarding Sinclair’s conduct as part of the last year’s FCC’s review of its proposed merger with Tribune. The Bureau believes that delaying consideration of this matter would not be in anyone’s interest.”  Sinclair said Thursday “this is part of an ongoing discussion initiated by Sinclair to work with the FCC to respond to certain allegations raised” last year by the FCC when it referred the issue for a hearing.  Sinclair could face fines from the FCC. In 2017, the FCC fined Sinclair $13.38 million for failing to disclose that programing on local TV stations that looked like news stories was sponsored by a cancer institute.  FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said Thursday that “any settlement negotiated behind closed doors will leave us with more questions than answers about one of the nation’s largest broadcasters. The FCC should hold a hearing in public on these questions and do it now.”  Tribune terminated the sale of 42 TV stations in 33 markets to Sinclair, which has 192 stations, in August. A month earlier the FCC referred the deal for a hearing, questioning Sinclair’s candor over the planned sale of some stations and suggesting Sinclair would effectively retain control over them.  An administrative judge in March dropped plans for a hearing into allegations that Sinclair may have misled regulators. Judge Jane Halprin added however that the allegations “are extremely serious charges that reasonably warrant a thorough examination.”  U.S. President Donald Trump backed the deal and its collapse potentially ended Sinclair’s hopes of building a national conservative-leaning TV powerhouse that might have rivaled Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s Fox News.  Nexstar Media Group Inc said in December it will buy Tribune in a $4.1 billion deal that would make it the largest regional U.S. TV station operator. The deal is still under review by the Justice Department and the FCC.  In May, Walt Disney Co  said it would sell its interests in 21 regional sports networks and Fox College Sports to Sinclair for $9.6 billion.

"Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — the aptly named FANG companies — are coming under increased scrutiny for their total market dominance. In their respective but more frequently overlapping areas of focus, these giants have collected enough information to hold an alarming amount of global influence. Chief among that, and perhaps most concerning, is the amount of data collected on us, the everyday users. Well past their inflection points, and with every single usage, these companies are woven deeper into the fabric of our lives. Some might even say more emphatically that they have become our everyday lives. Longtime technology follower David Kirkpatrick went as far as to say that the big breakthrough industries of the future will be characterized by meaningful barriers to entry — best-placed for those who own the most data. Groundbreaking innovations that fall within AI — like autonomous cars and specific advances like augmented reality — require significant capital and data, priming those markets for domination by an established core with deep pockets. Implicit in that is the limited space for startups to gain a footing in the market. Just as these juggernauts draw customers with less and less effort, the tipping-point status of their services makes not joining the Big Four feel like being left out, and they will win the war for talent. However, that is not what the view looks like from my position as CEO of a company whose charge is to find and place engineers, designers, product managers and data analysts at technology growth companies — startup tech companies in particular. I am happy to report that “talent” remains liquid. A flight to the top at the world’s most established technology companies is no longer the most sought-after route. This is indeed a different world from even a decade ago, when brilliant MBAs and engineers were often choosing between and opting for Google over Goldman. At that time, this was the ultimate indication of a changing of the guard. So what is giving the rest of the employer world a fighting chance? A smart man once said it’s hard to scale “special.” Keeping your mojo decades post-launch is no small feat, and while these companies have had tremendous impact on a global scale, they are now well past their teenage years and contain more layers. When engineers talk about what they look for in an employer, they often choose the opportunity to be a big fish (hero) in a small shop with grand ambition, over a small fish in a big shop that has already made its mark (a contributor). At the same time, transparency also becomes a challenge in a company of great size. Public-company transparency is one thing, but the transparency that many talented technology executives seek pertains to operations and leadership. They desire the enterprise-wide view that the startup environment provides, and many of them want to have a hand in driving a company’s broader development. The millennial and iGen crowd will soon be a majority in the workforce, and these generations crave a part in the next big thing. The disconnect is that FANG companies are the current big thing. Millennials and iGen believe in the art of the possible and embrace socially-minded missions. This is not to suggest that Google became evil or less socially conscious when, in 2015, it dropped “Don't be evil“ from its core values, but it did create a space for others to carry the torch. Young companies, with founders almost always still in tow, are as passionate a group as you can find. They tell the story of the mission — always prospective at this point in their life cycle — in such an effective way that VCs swoon and new talent wants to walk through fire. Most important is the evolution of the rest of the employer community outside of the obvious technology companies like Netflix or Cisco. Simply stated — by so many we can’t accurately attribute — every company is tech-centric. Technology is now a non-negotiable for enduring success. With these “tech-peripherals” — from giants of the oil industry to health insurers using data analytics to forecast patients most at risk — there are more ways to make a difference with technology than ever before. Engineering, data, design and product talent will always be coveted by companies across tech — the giants and the comers, and increasingly, the tech-peripherals. Make no mistake about it — it is a competitive battle. The FANG companies may very well receive continued criticism from regulators over their growing influence, but from where we sit, the future of innovation remains open to new breeds. How do we know this? Today, very little talent walks in our door and says, ""Can you get me a job at Google?” Rather, they say “Can you get me into the next Google?” David Saad is co-founder and CEO of SingleSprout, a specialized search firm focused on hiring engineering and product talent at tech companies.

"Facebook told a group of influential conservatives that it's considering revamping how it identifies Trending Topics in the wake of the recent controversy over alleged bias. The social network previously disclosed the websites and 1,000 media outlets it uses to corroborate reporting — a list with some notable omissions. ""There are some fairly prominent conservative news sites that weren't listed there,"" said Rob Bluey, editor in chief of the Daily Signal, the Heritage Foundation's news organization. ""They did talk about revamping Trending Topics."" Bluey suggested prominent conservative sites to include among those that Facebook's algorithm scours for topics of interest or for vetting stories — including Conservative Review, Newsmax, the Federalist and Townhall, as well as his own. The social network did not respond to a request seeking comment. Facebook has emerged as a powerful platform for news organizations, with more than one-third of 18- to 29-year-olds identifying social networks as their primary source for learning about the 2016 election, according to Pew Research. ""I told Mark and some of the other executives that the Daily Signal wouldn't be possible without Facebook,"" Bluey said. ""We launched two years ago, and Facebook is one of the platforms we use to reach our audience."" Bluey said he emerged from the meeting convinced that Zuckerberg is committed to ensuring that Facebook is a platform where everyone has a voice. ""They assured us they’re not out to get conservatives in any way,"" Bluey said. ""We don't have to worry about somebody sitting in a back office, secretly taking down conservative pages.""

"It's never been easy to be a metalhead in Turkey, where they're forced to exist under the ominous glare of a conservative culture and a state riddled with authoritarian tendencies. A lack of venues has plagued the country's DIY music scenes even in its biggest cities, and the few that do open their doors to metal music often have terrible sound systems. But these setbacks haven't stopped a vibrant underground metal scene from flourishing in Turkey, where a handful of active groups are playing killer black and death metal. Turkey is firmly under the control of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose AK Parti party has led the country for a decade and a half, dominating the political arena; they've become known for their violent repression of the country's Kurdish population, and lack of hesitation to jail dissidents on the flimsiest of charges (including actual elected members of parliament). Now, a critical election is approaching, one that Erdoğan called over a year early. If elected again, he will preside over a newly-installed presidential system designed to grant him even more power, and the suffocating chokehold he has over the country will remain for years to come. Add all that to a Turkish lira that has been plummeting rapidly this year, and you get an atmosphere that feels mildly apocalyptic—something that has bled into its underground metal scene. Despite its authoritarian government, Turkey is no Turkmenistan or North Korea, and there is still just enough freedom and space for underground scenes to thrive. The vitality of the underground metal scene was no more evident than at a recent festival in Ankara that brought 14 bands to the stage over the course of two days. Hundreds of metalheads came out, many traveling from cultural capital Istanbul. Showcased were among some of the country's best active metal units, who delivered passionate and thunderous performances in a basement rock bar where the stage was buttressed with a row of barrels that seemed to encourage stage-diving and crowd surfing. Not every band featured below appeared at the festival that weekend, but all are among the most important and exciting of their kind active today. Though opportunities to play are indeed few and far between, this hasn't thwarted Turkey's underground metal groups from cultivating a rich scene. They rage on.  Perhaps the most brutal performance of the weekend came from Engulfed, an Istanbul death metal quartet that formed in 2010. Hot off 2017's debut LP,  Engulfed in Obscurity, the band ripped through an airtight set and sounded like a pack of speed-addled rhinos pounding down a dusty road. Vocalist/bassist Serkan elaborately described the band's sound as, “the noise you hear while being dragged inside a dark tunnel, when everything positive in the universe is annihilated within eternal darkness, while taking pleasure in suffering and when everything sacred is being mercilessly destroyed.”  The band's usually frenetic pace is punctuated by slow, grim breakdowns laced with demonically appealing leads. Serkan cites visa problems as being one of the major inhibitors of the scene, preventing Turkish band from showcasing their sound abroad (Turks have to apply for Schengen visas to visit Europe; the application fees are expensive and arbitrary rejections are common.) Nevertheless, he appreciates the close-knit ties that bind the scene together and keep them motivated. “The numbers are small, but we have a metal scene composed of friends that are totally connected and look out for one another,” Serkan says.  Another powerfully talented Istanbul death metal outdit, Diabolizer, shares two members with Engulfed but opts to take more of a gratuitous, exuberant approach that doesn't lack in brutality. Their most recent effort is 2016's bruiser   Apokalypse  EP. Defiant, cackling melodic guitar parts dance effortlessly around a bottomless pit of doom. Headbangers in Ankara and Istanbul have been fortunate enough to catch the dazzling Diabolizer on stage at recent shows this year.  Perhaps the most eagerly-awaited band of the festival was Burial Invocation, which was formed in 2008 with roots in both Istanbul and Ankara. The four-piece's hotly anticipated debut full-length, Abiogenesis, is slated to come out later this year and blends savage vocals with manic drum work and impressive guitar trickery slathered in alternating dollops of brutality and melodic brilliance. European metalheads will be fortunate to catch the band across a number of countries on their tour of the continent in September and October of this year. “In my opinion, being a metalhead in Turkey is great; there are a number of great albums that will be released soon and some fantastic shows coming up,” says guitarist Cihan. “There are both new and old bands, the attendance at shows is good, and they are more soulful and fun than the underground shows I've seen in Europe."" Laying down a raw, sharp blend of death metal that blends power and precision, Hellsodomy (which also shares members with Engulfed and toured Europe together last year) is yet another mainstay of Turkey's underground metal scene. Their 2016 eight-song full length,  Chaostorm, is a barrage of throat-shredding vocals, skull-pounding drums, and razor-sharp solos. “There has been an increase in the attendance of shows, at every show there are people we haven't seen before. Though in a city of 15 million, the number of people coming out to a show is around 150. In a country with 81 provinces, we can only play in five,” guitarist Yunus says. On the positive side, “we've created this fantastic world within our own realm and are working to take things to the next level."" Described by vocalist Çağatay as “twisted, malignant metal” that will appeal to fans of black, death and thrash metal, Persecutory formed in Istanbul in 2014. After a year and a half hiatus, they roared back to the stage with an intense, memorable performance at the Ankara festival. Their debut LP,   Towards an Ultimate Extinction,  wastes no time descending into pure chaos and mayhem, laying the foundation for an absolutely catastrophic sound formed around Çagatay's anguished, searing vocals. “Being a metalhead is not a hobby for me, it's an identity,” Çağatay says, adding that many people in the scene end up losing interest entirely and then chastise active metalheads for their ongoing commitment. “Apart from three or four small bars that we've played at, venue owners don't take metal shows seriously and do not want to host them,” he adds.  Sarinvomit's sound is as vile and dark as its name implies. Sharing vocalists with Persecutory, this Istanbul unit is hot off the release of their debut,   Malignant Thermonuclear Supremacy, a throttling, crackbrained blend of extreme metal. Here, bloodthirsty vocals, battleaxe guitars, and blastbeats that make even the listener's wrists feel sore converge in a truly punishing fashion.  Long-running scene stalwarts Decaying Purity have been at it since 2005, enduring a number of lineup changes while amassing several releases and appearing at various festivals across Europe. The band, which describes its sound as “sickeningly brutal death metal punishment,” most recently released   Malignant Resurrection of the Fallen Souls,  a raging beast of an affair with filthy, venomous vocals and the impressive riff-repertoire of co-founder Mustafa, who also plays in Engulfed and Diabolizer. A new recording is reportedly in the works. Paul Benjamin Osterlund is a writer based in Istanbul; follow him on Twitter. ","turkeys-death-metal-scene-thrives-despite-government-repression

" Geyser eruptions are known as one of the most beautiful events to occur in nature. Not anymore! On September 15, Yellowstone Park’s Ear Spring geyser erupted, belching not just rocks and scalding hot water into the air, but dozens of pieces of human trash that were cooked for decades in incredibly hot water. Nice!  The National Park Service shared a picture of some of the artifacts recovered, which it claims are “clearly historic” and may end up in Yellowstone’s archives. The picture clearly shows a baby pacifier, a Solo Jazz cup, a plastic spoon, and some sort of tablet-like electronic device destroyed beyond recognition. There also seems to be a large slab of concrete or a cinder block.  “Foreign objects can damage hot springs and geysers,” representatives from the National Park Service said in a Facebook post. “You can help by never throwing anything into Yellowstone's thermal features!”  You would think it goes without saying, but yes, please do not hurl your trash into a scalding hot spring in the largest National Park in the country. If you’re thinking “Maybe I’ll throw just a little trash into the geyser,” No. Do not throw even a little trash into the geyser.  The National Park Service shared a photo of several dozen coins that were thrown into the geyer and were consequently scorched beyond recognition.

"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China has rejected U.S. requests for talks over how U.S. airlines and their websites refer to Chinese-claimed Taiwan, according to sources, including a U.S. official, adding to tensions in a relationship already frayed by a major trade dispute.  China has demanded that foreign firms, and airlines in particular, begin referring to Taiwan as Chinese territory on their websites, along with Hong Kong and Macau, a move described by the White House in May as “Orwellian nonsense”.   Numerous non-U.S. carriers, such as Air Canada, Lufthansa and British Airways have already made changes to their websites, according to Reuters checks.  But several U.S. companies, including Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, were among carriers that sought extensions to a May 25 deadline to make the changes. The final deadline is July 25.   In late May, the U.S. State Department presented China’s Foreign Ministry with a diplomatic note requesting consultations on the matter, but the ministry has since refused it, two sources briefed on the situation told Reuters.  “This has definitely become a foreign policy issue,” one of the sources said on condition of anonymity, noting that the U.S. government did not view it as a technical matter for bilateral aviation cooperation.    The spat had become “another grain of sand in the wound” amid escalating trade tensions, a second source said, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports to punish Beijing for intellectual property abuses.   An official with the State Department confirmed to Reuters that China had rejected its request for talks on June 25, adding that it was “disappointed” and had maintained close communication with the airlines but had not told them how to respond to Beijing’s demands.  “U.S. airlines should not be forced to comply with this order,” the State Department official said. “We have called on China to stop threatening and coercing American companies and citizens.”   Chinese companies are free to operate their websites without political interference in the United States, the official added.  China’s rebuff has left the U.S. government weighing its next move. The White House convened a staff-level meeting on the issue on Wednesday, but it is not clear what it plans to do.  Taiwan is China’s most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing considers the self-ruled, democratic island a wayward province. Hong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that are now part of China but run largely autonomously.  Armed by the United States, Taiwan has always been a major source of tension between Beijing and Washington, but it has been an increasingly contentious issue since Trump took office.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked about the rejection of discussing the issue with the United States, reiterated that Taiwan was an inseparable part of China and that this was the consensus of the international community.  Foreign companies in China must respect China’s law and the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he told a daily news briefing on Thursday.  Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrew H.C. Lee, said China’s demands over the issue “have reached new levels of hysteria”.   “Taiwan is grateful to the efforts of like-minded countries that have chosen to take a stand against Chinese bullying of private enterprises,” he said.  The companies have little incentive to defy Chinese regulations, but compliance could put them at odds with U.S. foreign policy.  Delta’s chief executive, Ed Bastian, said at a forum in Washington on Wednesday that the airline was working with the U.S. government but would not say whether it would comply.  “We’re working with the U.S. authorities on the topic and we’ll stay close to our U.S. government,” Bastian said, calling it a “good plan of action”.  The chief executive of United Airlines, Oscar Munoz, told Reuters in Washington on June 7 that the website issue was a “government-to-government diplomatic issue and again we’ll see what comes out of that and we’ll react accordingly”.  Asked if he would defer to the White House, Munoz said that “I fly to both places and I am deferential to our customers, and again this is not something I am going to solve”.  American Airlines said in early June that it had not made changes on its website, and that it was following the direction of the U.S. government.  It is unclear how China might seek to punish airlines that do not comply. But in December it changed rules governing foreign airlines operating in the country, including adding a clause that regulators could change a company’s permit if it did not meet “the demand of public interest”.

"Thousands of Poles took to the streets in mass demonstrations Thursday, after the president signed into law a new measure tightening the nationalist ruling party’s grip on the Supreme Court. Protesters gathered in front of Warsaw’s presidential palace and in more than 20 other cities and towns, chanting “Free courts” and “Shame.” Some held pens, a dig at President Andrzej Duda's willingness to sign off on the controversial amendment. Police used pepper spray on demonstrators who wrote slogans on the pavement in Warsaw. The new law is the latest in a series of judicial reforms by Poland’s nationalist government, which have sparked concerns over the independence of the judiciary and brought Warsaw into a tense standoff with Brussels. The amendment will effectively allow the nationalist Law and Justice-led government to choose the next Supreme Court chief. The measure follows reforms earlier this month that critics – including the court’s chief justice – labeled a “purge.” The government’s controversial move to lower the retirement age for the court’s judges to 65 from 70 forced about a third of them from the bench, and sparked widespread protests. Critics, including the European Union, said the move would result in the court being stacked with judges subservient to the government.

One report by pro-democracy think tank Freedom House said Law and Justice had transformed the Polish landscape “at breakneck speed, and in violation of the country’s own laws.”  Among other changes to Poland’s institutions, Law and Justice has removed dozens of judges from the country’s courts and tribunals. The party, which has long demonized the judiciary, says its overhauls are necessary to make the courts more efficient, and to uproot the legacy of Poland’s Communist past. “Without reforms, we cannot rebuild the Polish state so that it serves its citizens,” said party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski. The moves have brought Poland into a confrontation with the European Union, which trained the most powerful political weapon in its arsenal on Warsaw in December when it invoked, for the first time in its history, Article 7 of its founding treaty over Poland’s judicial reforms. Under that process, considered the EU’s “nuclear option,” Poland faces being stripped of its voting rights in the EU. But that would require unanimous approval by other member states, and Hungary, governed by another nationalist and euroskeptic party, has vowed to block any such move.   READ:   How Poland’s populist government let far-right extremism explode into the mainstream The EU’s highest court, the European Court of Justice, delivered a fresh indictment on the Polish legal system Wednesday when it ruled that Ireland could refuse to hand over an alleged drug dealer to Poland, if its judiciary determines he would not receive a fair trial there.  Ireland’s High Court had expressed reservations that the case could be compromised by the situation in Poland, and that the ruling will give other EU countries a legal basis to reject Polish extradition requests in the future.

"Sen. Tim Kaine made a point during the vice presidential debate of reminding the American public of that time Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers. “He started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals,” Kaine said, listing Trump’s most controversial campaign statements. “I cannot imagine how Gov. Pence can defend Donald Trump.” At first, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence responded with a laugh and a shrug — a seemingly implicit defense of Trump implying Kaine’s attack was unfounded (despite the fact that Trump really has said these things). But Pence’s initial lack of response didn’t stop Kaine. He used the same line four times Tuesday night. And by the fourth time, Pence had had enough. “Senator, you whipped out that Mexican thing again,” Pence retorted. “There are criminal aliens who have come into this country illegally, who are perpetrating violence. He also said, ‘and many of them are good people.’ Sen. Kaine, you keep leaving them out of your quote.” “That Mexican thing” was an unusually inarticulate moment for Pence that night, and Twitter noticed. Soon the hashtag #ThatMexicanThing was trending on Twitter. Figuring out what to do for lunch. Might do #thatMexicanthing on the corner. As Univision’s Jorge Ramos pointed out, it is an even more unfortunate turn of phrase for the vice president of a candidate that has had an extremely difficult time energizing the Latino vote: First Trump calls Mexicans ""rapists"". Now Pence says #ThatMexicanThing Question: Is that a creative strategy to win the Latino vote? Hillary Clinton supporters used it to express “things” Mexican immigrants actually do — work hard, play by the rules, pay taxes, participate in civic life as Americans, and so on. #ThatMexicanThing where undocumented immigrants pay more taxes than @realDonaldTrump does. #VPDebate #thatmexicanthing is my mom who immigrated to this country, pays her taxes and put two kids through college while managing a business ❤️ Look at me, I'm #ThatMexicanThing that has served in the military and graduated college. #NeverTrumpPence As Republican strategist Ana Navarro notes, Pence’s offhand remark has become a rallying cry for Mexican Americans to highlight their life experiences in the United States, in the face of Trump and Pence’s immigration-skeptical policy proposals. Latino Twitter abuzz. #ThatMexicanThing now a hashtag Mexican-Americans using to share stories on American dream/work ethic/sacrifices made. https://t.co/HgrfWJrpD9 The Clinton campaign also seized on it quickly: www.thatMexicanthing.com now redirects to Hillary Clinton’s campaign website, and Clinton’s campaign is doing its darnedest to make the hashtag #ThatMexicanThing the takeaway from Tuesday’s debate. It’s an illustration of just how savvy campaigns can be in the face of a losing performance, but it is also a reflection of what Kaine was trying do all night: sink Pence down to Trump’s level. If the Clinton campaign succeeds in elevating this debate moment, Kaine’s otherwise damaging interruptions will not have been enacted in vain. Kaine’s strategy was to make Pence defend Trump. It didn’t play out like he hoped, unless this works. Kaine’s finest moments in the debate were when he listed Trump’s most reprehensible campaign moments — but a lot of them were undermined by his overeagerness to jump into the role of attack dog. He interrupted Pence often, interjecting with Trump’s past transgressions. It gave Republicans fodder for a simple post-debate attack video, creating a supercut of all the times Kaine jumped in on Pence’s time. This allowed Republicans to create space for the argument that there’s nothing sexist about the way Trump interrupted Clinton last week at the first debate since her running mate used the same tactic. But Pence’s inarticulate moment also highlighted the fact that he had no intention of defending Trump. One of the few times he tried to became a memeable moment, which the Clinton campaign has been quick to co-opt. Pence’s retort didn’t age well overnight, as media outlets begin to pick up on it on Wednesday and the Clinton campaign continues to push it as Tuesday’s takeaway. Ultimately, Pence’s remark may not matter in the grand scheme of the election, as vice presidential debates so often don’t, but it undermines a real opportunity for the Trump campaign — a potentially positive news cycle for the first time in more than a week.",how-the-clinton-campaign-is-making-thatmexicanthing-a-thing-explained.txt,drew.uq
"Virgin Atlantic is no longer requiring women flight attendants to wear makeup — and, for the first time, they’ll be offered pants as part of their default uniform. In the past, the airline’s standards for women who worked on board were fairly stringent: The airline reportedly has a style guide for flight attendants that includes instructions on what types of makeup they are and aren’t allowed to wear, and women were only provided trousers for their uniforms upon request. The airline is framing the move as a push toward gender equality in a line of work that remains heavily divided along gender lines: Most pilots are still men and most flight attendants are still women. “Not only do the new guidelines offer an increased level of comfort, they also provide our team with more choice on how they want to express themselves at work,” Virgin Atlantic executive VP Mark Anderson told CNN in a statement. “Our world-famous red uniform is something all of us at Virgin Atlantic are incredibly proud of. As an airline, we have always stood out from the crowd and done things differently to the rest of the industry. We want our uniform to truly reflect who we are as individuals while maintaining that famous Virgin Atlantic style.” While the new guidelines allow crew members to opt out of wearing makeup, those who choose to do so will still have to adhere to Virgin’s style guide. The new guidelines also underscore how strictly flight attendants’ appearances are enforced to this day — and the extent to which the aviation industry continues to play into outdated gender stereotypes. It’s worth noting that although flight attendants in general are expected to adhere to rigid gender norms, there is a rich history of queer flight attendants — last year, Virgin offered its first-ever Pride flight to New York City, which was entirely staffed by LGBT employees — but the industry continues to uphold rigid gender norms. As gender sociologist Lisa Wade has noted, the first flight attendants were men, and early airlines often had bans on hiring women. But the profession quickly became dominated by women, who were expected to play the role of cheerful domestic worker and sexpot to appeal to largely male travelers. A post shared by Virgin Atlantic (@virginatlantic) on Oct 30, 2018 at 11:36am PDT Even today, the overwhelming majority of flight attendants are women, and most airlines, especially those that provide luxury services, still require their cabin crews to adhere to strict dress codes. In a 2018 interview with Town and Country, an Emirates flight attendant revealed that the airline has rules for what colors of nail polish employees are allowed to wear, as well as guidelines for lipstick — which is required — eye makeup, jewelry, and hair styles. Cosmopolitan compiled a list of different airlines’ requirements, which range from standard things like customer service to more outlandish rules like how much flight attendants can weigh, what range their body mass index should fall into, and how long their nails should be. American Airlines reportedly requires cabin crew members to “cut or otherwise remove” “noticeable hair in nostrils and/in on ears or underarms.” JetBlue employees are allowed to put their hair in ponytails, but they “should be no higher than the tops of the ears and no longer than the tops of the shoulders.” The list goes on and on. Virgin’s relaxed rules could be a sign of broader change. The airline called the move a “significant change for the aviation industry,” something that would normally sound like brand-speak, but in this case seems to be true.",virgin-atlantic-uniform-flight-attendants-no-longer-have-to-wear-makeup.txt,drew.uq
"DUBLIN (Reuters) - The International Energy Agency (IEA) is very concerned about the impact that tensions in the Middle East may have on global energy security and will act if there is any physical disruption to supplies, its executive director said on Monday.  Oil prices rose on Monday, extending large gains last week that were prompted by tensions between the United States and Iran, although concerns about the possibility of weakening demand kept a lid on gains.  Strong growth in the price of U.S. shale oil has also contained stronger increases, the IEA’s Fatih Birol added on Monday.  “We are monitoring the situation very closely and are very worried. In case of physical disruption, we are ready to act in an appropriate way,” Birol told a news conference at the IEA’s annual energy efficiency conference in Dublin.  Last week, benchmark Brent crude climbed 5% and U.S. crude < CLc1> surged 10% after Iran shot down a U.S. drone on Thursday in the Gulf, adding to strains stoked by attacks on oil tankers in the area in May and June that Washington has blamed on Iran.  Iran denies any role in the tanker attacks.  Birol said earlier this month that the attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, which stoked concern of reduced flows of crude on one of the world’s key shipping routes, threatened global energy security.   However on Monday he cited the strength of U.S. shale oil prices for supporting the market, similar to the buffer it provided through U.S. sanctions imposed on oil exporters Iran and Venezuela.  “This would definitely have bad implications for the global economy but despite those attacks, we have not seen a major impact on the prices and the main reason is United States shale oil prices are growing so strongly that there is a lot of oil in the markets now,” he said.   “It provides a ceiling on the price hikes which is very good news for consumers around the world.”  Reporting by Padraic Halpin, editing by Louise Heavens",iea-concerned-about-middle-east-tensions-stands-ready-to-act.txt,drew.uq
"Lin-Manuel Miranda's vowing to return to ""Hamilton"" in honor of President Obama commuting the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera -- who was convicted for conspiracy against the U.S. government -- and some cops are outraged. Miranda said he'd be honored to play Alexander Hamilton if Rivera goes to see the play in Chicago after his release in May. Rivera has been serving a 70 year sentence since the '80s for involvement in the FALN -- a Puerto Rican liberation organization that conducted fatal bombings in NYC and an attack on NYPD headquarters. The argument for Rivera's release has been that he was never convicted of killing anyone, and only for seditious conspiracy, but a high-ranking member of NYPD tells TMZ, ""It's a slap in the face of every hard working NYPD officer that the President would commute the sentence of a terrorist, and for [Miranda] to honor a terrorist is appalling.""

"(Reuters) - Roman Catholic leaders in Texas on Thursday identified around 300 priests and others accused of sexually abusing children.  It was one of the largest groups of names disclosed by the church as it faces U.S. state and federal investigations into its handling of decades of allegations of sexual misconduct by priests.   The names were posted online by the state’s 15 Catholic dioceses and follow an August grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailing seven decades of abuse of thousands of children by more than 300 priests.   “The Bishops of Texas have decided to release the names of these priests at this time because it is right and just and to offer healing and hope to those who have suffered,” said Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of the Galveston-Houston diocese, who is also president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.  In the months after the Pennsylvania report, dozens of other dioceses around the United States have released the names of hundreds of priests and others accused of abuse. Some states have opened their own investigations into the church.   Texas’ Catholic dioceses have been in the spotlight since November when authorities searched the offices of the archdiocese of Galveston-Houston looking for documents related to a priest charged in September with sex crimes.  About 30 percent of Texas’ population, or 8.5 million people, identify as Catholics, one of the highest rates for any U.S. state, according to the USCCB.  Some of the 15 Texas dioceses listed priests accused of abuse going back as far as the 1940s. Others like Laredo only went back to 2000, when it was created, and listed no names.   It was not clear whether the release of names would result in prosecutors bringing charges. The majority of the priests identified in Texas have died, as is the case in most dioceses around the country.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee on Friday asked the Trump administration to disclose an estimate of the number of Americans whose digital communications are incidentally collected under foreign surveillance programs, according to a letter seen by Reuters.  Such an estimate is “crucial as we contemplate reauthorization,” of parts of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that are due to expire at the end of the year, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican, and John Conyers, the panel’s top Democrat, wrote in a letter addressed to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.  The request comes as some Republican lawmakers, many of whom have stridently defended U.S. surveillance programs in the past, express sudden interest in considering additional privacy safeguards to how U.S. spy agencies collect and share intelligence that contains information about Americans.  That interest has been sparked by evolving, unsubstantiated assertions that the Obama White House used surveillance powers to improperly spy on the incoming Trump administration.  Privacy advocates have for years demanded that the U.S. government share an estimate of how many Americans are ensnared by programs authorized under a certain part of FISA, known as Section 702, that allows for the collection of vast quantities of internet communications from foreigners believed to be living overseas.   Some experts and lawmakers have said they believe data on  millions of Americans could be caught under such surveillance, exposing them to warrantless searches by federal investigators.  “It is clear that Section 702 surveillance programs can and do collect information about U.S. persons, on subjects unrelated to counter-terrorism,” wrote Goodlatte and Conyers, who requested a response by April 24. “It is imperative that we understand the size of this impact on U.S. persons as our committee proceeds with the debate on reauthorization.”  In a separate letter sent last December to the outgoing Obama administration, members of the House Judiciary Committee said they were given assurances by officials that an estimate would be provided, likely by January of this year.  Richard Ledgett, the deputy director of the National Security Agency, said “yes” when asked by a Reuters reporter last month whether an estimate would be provided before year end. He also said about 20 “vignettes” would be publicly released that show the important national security value of Section 702, which officials have described as among the most important intelligence tools at their disposal.  Section 702 will expire on Dec. 31, 2017, absent congressional action.

"Ryan Lochte hijinks aside, the weirdest thing to happen lately in the actual Olympics competition happened on the track in Rio. Now it's going to lead to a special made-for-TV run-off tonight. The U.S. women's 4x100 meter relay was disqualified from the semifinal heat this morning after Allyson Felix dropped the baton during a handoff with English Gardner after running the second leg. It looked like another embarrassing outcome for the U.S. relay team. The women's 4x100 team dropped the baton in 2004 and 2008, while the men's team did it in 2008 and 2012. But the U.S. team filed a protest, saying that a Brazilian runner had crowded into the US lane and bumped Felix, causing her to drop the baton. And guess what? It actually worked! Now the U.S. will run again Thursday night at 7 p.m. Eastern time to try to make the finals. They just have to beat the eighth place time—42.70 seconds by China. But it's also going to be weird.

""When a foreign object comes in front of you, it's going to mess up the momentum and the handover."" Just one more wrinkle though: It could get even weirder and tense.

"WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CALGARY, Alberta, June 9 (Reuters) - F ears about oil spills into the Great Lakes from two aging U.S. pipelines have flared, raising doubts about their future and creating fresh headaches for operator Enbridge Inc and the Canadian energy sector.  Canada has faced years of delay in getting new oil pipelines built because of environmental opposition, resulting in severe congestion in Alberta, the country’s main crude-producing province, that forced the provincial government to impose production cuts this year. Pipelines face increasing scrutiny from environmental groups worried about leaks, and U.S. Great Lakes states are taking a hard look at the risks.  The Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled on June 3 that the environmental impact statement for Enbridge’s Line 3 failed to properly address the spill risk in Lake Superior, imposing a fresh challenge to the company’s construction schedule. Also last week, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer repeated a threat to shut down Line 5 unless Enbridge accelerated its timeline to replace it.  “That is a real-time problem because (Line 3) was the most imminent chance for Canadian production to see some pressure release on the system,” said Rafi Tahmazian, senior portfolio manager at Canoe Financial, which owns shares of Canadian Natural Resources and other oil producers. “It’s disappointing and concerning.”  Enbridge shares dropped 5 percent in Toronto last week, hovering near a three-month low.  Line 3 carries oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Line 5 takes oil from Wisconsin to refineries in Sarnia, Ontario, passing through the Straits of Mackinac channel connecting Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Both were built in the 1960s.  In a statement on Friday, Enbridge said it was still analyzing the court’s decision on Line 3.  Without a valid environment statement, Enbridge’s certificate of need and route permit, which it received from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) a year ago over boisterous opposition, are void.  Minnesota’s Department of Commerce and Enbridge must now re-draft the statement to the PUC’s satisfaction, a process likely to take at least six months, said Alexandra Klass, a University of Minnesota law professor.  Enbridge has previously said it expects to have the remaining Minnesota permits for Line 3 by November and will put it into service in the second half of 2020. It has not said how the appeal court’s ruling may now affect that plan.  “As of now they do not have any valid state permits,” Klass said. “I don’t know their construction schedule, but it does seem ambitious.”  PUC officials declined to comment.  With no valid environment statement, Minnesota’s natural resources department and pollution control agency cannot issue the required state permits either, said Scott Strand, lawyer for the Friends of the Headwaters environmental group.  “It doesn’t seem likely that the calendar can just stay in place,” he said.  The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency must issue Line 3’s water quality certification by Oct. 30 or Enbridge would need to re-apply, re-starting a year-long process, said spokesman Darin Broton.  Minnesota’s Department of Natural Resources said in a statement that it was determining its next steps.  In Michigan, Enbridge said it is taking legal action regarding Line 5 to enforce agreements with a previous Michigan administration that allowed it to build a tunnel under the Straits to replace an underwater section of pipe. The governor has said she fears anchors from boats could rupture the existing pipe.  Whitmer’s insistence on shutting down Line 5 in two years, ahead of the 2024 completion date for the tunnel, led to Enbridge’s legal action, the company said.  Whitmer wrote to Enbridge CEO Al Monaco on Monday saying that she wants a firm date to shut down the underwater portion of the pipeline, and that the state could otherwise shut down Line 5. She did not comment further on Friday.

"(Reuters) - WPP (WPP.L) is in exclusive talks to sell a majority stake in its data analytics unit Kantar to private equity firm Bain Capital, it said on Monday, in a $4 billion deal aimed at steering the world’s biggest advertising company back to growth.   The news puts an end to months of speculation around the heavily-contested auction which drew interest from a broad spectrum of buyout firms that are flush with cash to invest.   WPP had shortlisted a series of U.S. buyout funds to submit binding bids for a majority stake in Kantar including Apollo and Platinum, Reuters reported in May.  The auction, led by Goldman Sachs and part of the company’s efforts to raise cash, kicked off last year and also drew interest from European private equity houses CVC Capital Partners and Permira.  In a statement on Monday, WPP said Kantar was valued at $4 billion including debt. Bain’s proposal was subject to negotiation and it was not certain the talks would result in a deal, the company said.  Shares of WPP closed up 2.2% at 1,012 pence on Monday after media reports reported earlier in the day that Bain emerged as the leading bidder.  Bain’s interest in Kantar is the latest private equity deal to emerge in recent weeks. Blackstone and Lego’s founding family on Friday took Merlin Entertainments (MERL.L) private in a $7.5 billion deal, in one of the biggest private equity deals in Europe in recent years.  Nestle (NESN.S) also said in May it was in exclusive talks to sell its skin health business to a consortium led by EQT Partners for 10.2 billion Swiss francs ($10.33 billion).  Kantar’s underlying sales fell 2% last year to 2.6 billion pounds with operating profit down 14% to 301 million pounds.  The business generates about 15% of WPP’s overall sales and provides brand and marketing communications research for some of the world’s largest advertisers.   It has traditionally weighed on WPP’s overall organic growth rates - a key measurement for the industry.  Analysts say Kantar risks losing market share to more tech-savvy peers, while its business model is challenged by consumer goods companies developing their own data teams, rather than relying on surveys undertaken by external firms.  First-quarter results in April showed the British company has been particularly hard hit in the United States, where a weak competitive performance in recent years has been compounded by the loss of work from Ford and others in 2018.  WPP, the owner of agencies including JWT and Ogilvy, is in the middle of an overhaul following several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018 and turmoil linked to founder Martin Sorrell’s abrupt departure over a complaint of misconduct, which he denied.  With technology transforming the way advertising is made, placed and sold, clients want WPP to better integrate its agencies so it can produce faster offerings across multiple platforms, at a cheaper cost.  WPP’s Mark Read, who took the helm of the 12-billion pound advertising giant last year, has pledged to spend 300 million pounds restructuring the group to bring it back in line with peers by the end of 2021.  Read, a soft-spoken executive who worked alongside Sorrell for decades, set out a plan in December to hire more creative staff, including around 1,000 new jobs to improve its senior leadership in its New York agencies, in a bid to return the company to growth.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Like the deal-maker he says he is, U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be keeping his options open as his Republican Party threatens to erupt into full-scale war.   On Monday, almost immediately after saying he empathized with the effort by his former strategist Steve Bannon to back challenges against Republican senators in next year’s congressional elections, Trump stood with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, pledging party unity and saying they were “fighting for the same thing.”  For months, McConnell had been the object of Trump’s wrath for the failure of the Republican-led Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare - a longtime Republican goal and a key promise of Trump’s 2016 campaign.  In the White House Rose Garden, Trump played down any conflict, saying the two were “closer than ever before.”  But Trump would not disavow Bannon’s pledge to take down Republicans who are not fully behind Trump’s agenda and to drive McConnell from the Senate’s leadership.  Bannon, who helped mastermind Trump’s election campaign but left the White House in August, appeared at a gathering of conservative activists on Saturday and declared: “Right now, it’s a season of war against a GOP establishment.”  In comments directed at McConnell, Bannon told the gathering: “Up on Capitol Hill, it’s like the Ides of March. They’re just looking to find out who is going to be Brutus to your Julius Caesar.”  Brutus, once an ally of Caesar, was among the assassins of the Roman leader on the Ides of March in 44 B.C.  Working with well-funded outside political groups, Bannon is encouraging anti-establishment candidates to challenge Republican incumbents in the party’s nominating races for the 2018 elections in which all the seats in the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate are up for election.  Republican leaders, such as McConnell, worry that the anti-establishment candidates might be less palatable to general election voters and cause Republicans to lose their majority in the Senate and possibly also the House.  Asked about Bannon before a meeting of his Cabinet on Monday, Trump said he could “understand where Steve Bannon’s coming from” and took a jab at the Republican-led Congress in the process.   “We’re not getting the job done,” Trump said. “And I’m not going to blame myself, I’ll be honest. They are not getting the job done.”  At the later news conference with McConnell, Trump said, however, he may try to persuade Bannon not to back primary challengers in several upcoming congressional races.  “Steve is doing what Steve thinks is the right thing,” Trump said. “Some of the people that he may be looking at (challenging), I’m going to see if we talk him out of that, because frankly, they’re great people.”  Still, when McConnell went further, criticizing Bannon for favoring fringe candidates who cannot “appeal to a broader electorate,” Trump was noticeably silent.  Trump is still stinging from his decision to support the Republican incumbent in the recent Alabama Senate primary, Luther Strange, at McConnell’s behest. Strange was beaten handily by arch-conservative Roy Moore, the challenger backed by Bannon.   While it has been unusual for a president to support a primary challenger in his own party, Trump has signaled he may be willing to do so in states such as Arizona, where Senator Jeff Flake, up for re-election next year, has been critical of the White House.

"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Do words limit our experience of a given artwork? Gustave Flaubert believed that, “Explaining one artistic form by means of another is a monstrosity.” Art critic John Berger wrote: “When words are applied to visual art, both lose precision.” And what if the words are in the art? Expressed by the artist herself? From Cubism to conceptual art, the 20th century saw a spike in the appropriation of words in visual expression. Of course, there are earlier examples, like illuminated manuscripts, Egyptian hieroglyphs, or the works of visual poets like William Blake. But it was in the 1960s especially that the boundaries between the seemingly distinct art forms really began to blur. Marcel Broodthaers was a product of this time. Currently having a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the Belgian is hailed for being innovative with written and visual language, borrowing from Marcel Duchamp, René Magritte (a contemporary and friend), and Pop art, while giving these influences a new twist. Let’s start with Broodthaers’s first work of art, which he made at the age of 40, when he decided to move on from writing poetry. Well, sort of. He took unsold copies of his most recent collection of poetry, Pense-Bête (“Memory Aid”) (1964), and encased them in plaster and egg shells so that they hardened into monuments and useless objects. At MoMA, one of these books is placed near an invitation to his first exhibition: a series of magazine spreads that Broodthaers painted over with the words, “I, too, wondered whether I couldn’t sell something …” The start of his visual art career is marked by a bitterness, and even a sense of revenge, that never really goes away. In addition to eggshells, Broodthaers had a penchant for mussel shells. These remnants appear in dense geometric patterns, spilling out of pots, crammed into a cabinet, or piled on a chair. At times, he is heavy-handed or obvious in his symbolism, fixing egg shells to the Belgian flag or smearing black, explosive globs of manufactured eggs on a newspaper reporting Belgium’s 1960 invasion of Congo. These works surround you with noisy clutter that is resoundingly empty, recalling the art that copied and critiqued consumer culture at the time. The MoMA likes to stress that Broodthaers “distanced his photographic reproductions from those of Pop” by copying his own works. The results, however, are generally less than inspiring, including a display of glass bottles that he painted words over, set before a photograph of those same objects. In a concurrent Broodthaers exhibition titled, appropriately, Écriture at Michael Werner, three sheets of paper, each placed in individual typewriters, read, from left to right: “Parle,” “Ecrit,” “Copie” (“Speak,” “Write,” “Copy”). He seems to say that words, like images, in being reproduced, risk their originality. With both existing in the same systems of meaning, Broodthaers believed that “The language of forms must reunite with that of words.” At its most stimulating, his work reflects on how we understand the world through words and images, and how we fit them into one another. Which contains which? In one series, Broodthaers transforms the words of Stéphane Mallarmé’s poem “A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance” (1897) into sleek bars of various thicknesses and lengths. In another, he pairs objects, à la Magritte, with poetic, unusual, and surreal written associations: “style” with a glass bottle; “subject” with a hat; “pipe” with a palette. Similarly, in Series in the French Language (1972), Broodthaers matches the names of well-known writers and artists with unexpected or even inaccurate descriptors that often switch the roles of the writer and visual artist, such as “Charles Baudelaire Peint” (“Charles Baudelaire Paints”). Like Henri Michaux (another Belgian poet-artist), Broodthaers made words painterly subjects by scribbling letters and sentences on canvases. At times, he even used words in protest of images — in response to Minimalism, where form reigned supreme, he writes, in the 1968 oil on canvas work of the same name: “there are no primary structures.” For him, it was words that underly creation and give shape to images. “An artist does not construct a volume. He writes a volume,” he said. The latter work is featured in his Musée d’Art Moderne, Département des Aigles (Museum of Modern Art, Department of Eagles), a traveling conceptual museum that Broodthaers developed between 1968 and 1971. Here we see a series of pamphlets and letters declaring his vision for the project that re-appropriates and mocks the museum as an institution. In one of his “décors,” or sets alluding to the privileged rooms of the bourgeoisie, titled “Un Jardin d’Hiver II” (“Winter Garden II,” 1974), he created a room of palm trees where pictures of exotic birds hang on the wall, alluding to the colonialist origins of museums. Why eagles? We are brought back to a poem of his that opens the exhibition: “O sadness assent of wild ducks / Assault of birds at the forest granary / O Melancholy bitter castle of eagles.” As a MoMA label says, the eagle is “a bird that symbolizes autonomy and solitude, and which had come to represent the artist.” I cannot help but see his bitter castle as his attempt to establish some sense of authority, of payback for not earning the success he felt he deserved as a writer. Beneath his art lies a fervid will for and insistence on writing. In the video “La pluie (projet pour un texte),” we see him writing in a downpour, unfazed and triumphant. In “La Salle blanche” (“The white room,” 1975) — another of his décors — Broodthaers recreates a room of his apartment and prints words associated with art-making, like “color,” “subjects,” “paper,” “shadow,” and “bright,” on the white walls and floors. The scene conjures the image of an artist in her room, as her thoughts about her art reflect and swim about her. Again, the implication here is that words are at the source of art — a message, in the end, that feels, at least for a viewer today, a little trite. I try once more to gaze over the words — “gallery, “black,” “figure,” “copy” — but I have trouble moving beyond their literal nature. I am, quite frankly, a little bored — they’re like the words AP Art History classes use to describe Western painting. In an effort to get us thinking about art as more than objects, Broodthaers encases it with written language. But his words don’t always feel integrated into the artwork; rather, they speak at the art, to the image referenced. Perhaps, in this sense, he is more like a type of critic. Which brings us back to Flaubert and Berger: Do words and images, like oil and water, not mix? Perhaps it’s the words Broodthaers chose that make his works too literal and obvious, or his curmudgeonly tone that distracts them from their poetry. But, in the end, he probably should’ve stuck with words. Marcel Broodthaers: A Retrospective continues at the Museum of Modern Art (11 West 53rd Street, Midtown, Manhattan) through May 15.

"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary has no evidence that equipment from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei poses a security threat, a government minister said on Thursday, adding that Budapest was mulling incentives to accelerate the rollout of a high-speed 5G network.  The United States and some of its Western allies believe Huawei Technologies’ equipment could be used for espionage, and see its expansion into central Europe as a way to gain a foothold in the European market. Huawei denies the accusations.  Washington is concerned in particular about the expansion of Huawei, the world’s biggest maker of telecoms equipment, in Hungary and Poland.  Budapest has so far shrugged off the security concerns and on Thursday Innovation and Technology Minister Laszlo Palkovics told Reuters that Hungary had yet to receive any evidence beyond what he called accusations leveled at Huawei.  “We have taken a rather pragmatic stance, the same, in fact, as Germany,” Palkovics said. “It has not been proven that Huawei’s technology would pose any risk to Hungary, as we have seen no (data) to support that.”  “Until it is proven that Huawei, or Cisco or any other technology poses any threat to our community, that is Hungary, NATO or the European Union, we will handle Huawei’s technology as any other technology,” he added.   Palkovics’ comments follow the Hungarian telecoms regulator NMHH’s publication this week of the draft documentation for the sale of more than 400 megahertz of 5G spectrum later this year. This fires the starting gun on the rollout of a high-speed wireless network expected to serve self-driving cars and real-time communication between machines.  He said the country expected the auction to raise about 70 billion forints ($244.67 million).   Huawei employs around 2,000 people in Hungary, where it has invested $1.2 billion since 2005 according to company figures. Its European Supply Centre near Budapest, launched in 2009, is Huawei’s biggest production base outside China, the group says.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government has strengthened business ties with Beijing over the past years.  Acknowledging that Hungary’s technological acumen lagged that of its U.S. and German allies, Palkovics said Budapest was studying the example of Germany where he said an assessment system was developed to precisely identify possible security threats. Germany is Hungary’s biggest foreign investor.  “I am positive, that if it were to become obvious that (there is a security risk), Hungary is a member of NATO, which entails a spate of commitments, which we will follow, but so far, there has been no information to support that,” he said.  Deutsche Telekom unit Magyar Telekom has installed Huawei and Cisco Systems Inc equipment at a 5G test base in western Hungary.  Asked whether Huawei could participate without restrictions in the rollout of Hungary’s 5G network, Palkovics said:  “Once other, technologically more advanced countries launch the rollout that way, we will follow suit. If they do not, we will not either.”  Palkovics said the government was planning talks with telecoms companies and other players in the sector on ways to facilitate a faster rollout of 5G.  The minister said he had met representatives of Germany’s Siemens and car maker BMW, which plans to build a 1 billion euro factory in eastern Hungary, for talks on possible uses of 5G technology.  “In Germany, Siemens and BMW have proposed that there should be an available spectrum for in-house applications. These companies are also present in Hungary and they have proposed the same,” he said, adding that these frequencies would be allotted in a second stage of the Hungarian 5G tender.

"The New York Times weddings section is renowned for its obsession with status, providing a window into what the world’s most self-important people deem to be important. Sex and the City references the section repeatedly, and many publications have taken to scrutinizing couples’ credentials over the years. In 2013, I built Wedding Crunchers, a search engine for the express purpose of analyzing NYT wedding announcements, and published an exploration of trends across 35 years of what I dubbed ""yuppie nuptials."" Three years after my first effort, if feels like an opportune time to revisit the analysis and take a look at some new trends. The data set now includes more than 63,000 wedding announcements dating back to 1981, and a lot has changed in the weddings section since then. The latest data shows that: Some things remain the same — the omnipresence of the Ivy League, lawyers, and Wall Street, to name a few — but with the preamble out of the way, let’s dive in and see what we can learn. The NYT only recently began including information about how couples met, whether in college, online, at SoulCycle, or by some other method. I extracted this ""how they met"" data from 702 announcements since August 2015 and assigned each announcement to a high-level category. Here’s how the meeting spots of the NYT wedding section break down. Based on 702 New York Times wedding announcements published since August 23, 2015 Schools account for more introductions than any other category, with colleges outnumbering graduate programs by about a 2-to-1 ratio. The somewhat vague ""met via mutual friends"" comes in a close second, followed by online dating and what I labeled ""happenstance,"" which applies to announcements that say something like ""they met at a bar"" or, in one case, at Burning Man. The ""organized activity"" label I created includes couples who met doing things like volunteering for political campaigns, playing in kickball leagues, or attending church. The ""other"" bucket is something of a catchall, including couples who were set up on blind dates, met at other weddings, or were childhood friends. There are clearly some universities that dominate the wedding listings. Of the 188 couples who met at school, 15 met at Harvard, more than any other institution. On the right is the full list of schools that produced more than five couples. Older couples are more likely to have met online or via mutual friends. I also parsed out age data for each individual, so I could make the same ""how they met"" graph for people in their 20s, 30s, and over 40. Based on 702 New York Times wedding announcements published since August 23, 2015 It’s interesting, if not surprising, to see how the frequencies change based on age group. Almost half of 20-somethings in the NYT weddings section met in school, compared with only 2 percent of the 40-plus demographic. As people get older, it’s more likely they met via mutual friends or online. I was curious which dating services were most frequently mentioned, so I took all the couples who met online and split them further by the particular services they used. Based on 87 New York Times wedding announcements published since August 23, 2015 OkCupid leads the pack, having introduced 39 couples, while Match and JDate follow with 16 and nine couples, respectively. Tinder and Hinge have four each, but their numbers might be limited by a selection bias. Phone-based dating apps are relatively new, so it’s nearly impossible that a couple who met online five years ago could have met using a phone-based app (though shout-out to Reverend Dennis Tinder, who officiated this 1988 wedding, cementing his status as the first ""Tinder"" appearance in the weddings section). The ""other"" bucket includes a handful of dating services that appear in one announcement each, and some folks who met online even though they didn’t use a dating service. One recent couple met on Instagram, proving that even in the relatively staid world of the NYT, it can, and does, go down in the DM. While Tinder and Hinge have each introduced four NYT couples, Tinder is winning a subtler competition for notoriety. Whenever Tinder appears in an announcement, it requires no additional description, whereas Hinge is always referred to as ""the dating app Hinge."" The implication is that of course people know what Tinder is, but maybe they’ve never heard of Hinge, much in the same way that Goldman Sachs is consistently described as the investment bank, while less notable companies are often ""an investment bank."" Here are the relevant excerpts: People in the NYT Weddings Section have been getting older over time. Wedding announcements started including ages in 1989, when the median age was 27 for women and 29 for men. As of 2016, the median ages have increased to 30 for women and 32 for men. In 1989 you were twice as likely to see a 20-something in the weddings section as you were a 30-something, but as of 2016 the 30-somethings have taken over the majority, presumably to the chagrin of expectant grandparents throughout the tristate area: Based on 38,274 New York Times wedding announcements published since 1989 Same-sex couples are an exception to this trend: The median age of same-sex couples was 43 in 2011 and has since fallen to 35. But that might be an artifact of the legal process: When New York state recognized same-sex marriage in 2011, there was likely a backlog of older couples who would have been married years earlier had it been been allowed, and these older couples would cause the median age to skew higher shortly after the official recognition. Wedding Crunchers lets you search for words and phrases, then returns a graph that shows you how frequently they appear in weddings announcements. This is called an ""n-gram analysis,"" where the y-axis represents the average number of occurrences per announcement. So for example, if you see a y-axis value of 0.1 for a word, it means that word appears an average of 0.1 times per announcement. NYT wedding announcements lend themselves nicely to n-gram analysis because they’re fairly consistently structured, including data on where people went to school, their job titles, who officiated the ceremony, and more. The special Vows articles are an exception: They are longer and don’t follow the standard announcement structure, so Wedding Crunchers specifically excludes Vows articles from n-gram results. As of May 2016 there are 63,000 wedding announcements in the Wedding Crunchers database. New York is widely known as the financial capital of the United States, if not the world, and it shouldn’t be surprising that a lot of married folks work in the financial industry. In more recent years, the city has grown its presence in the technology sector as well, embodied by Google pulling even with Goldman Sachs in NYT wedding announcement mentions: There are, of course, of more scientific ways to compare NYC’s tech and financial industries beyond cherry-picking wedding announcement mentions for two particular companies. Employment and wage data might be good places to start, but I’d argue that NYT wedding mentions get at something core to New York City's prestige-obsessed culture that would be difficult to quantify with traditional employment data alone. Put another way: I doubt that people explicitly choose jobs by asking themselves, ""What would look best in my future NYT wedding announcement?"" But I’d also suspect that the answer to that question is highly correlated with people’s actual decisions, at least for the people who end up in the weddings section. So although Google and Goldman Sachs are just two companies among many, the fact that Google appears as frequently as the most prestigious investment bank suggests that at least a certain brand of tech company now rivals investment banks for prestige. Startups are on the rise, too, though lest we get ahead of ourselves, they’re still only a tiny blip on the radar compared with law firms and banks, the most traditional of all NYT wedding professional institutions: It seems like everyone is hawking a mobile app these days, and NYT wedded couples are no exception. Instances of ""mobile apps"" and related phrases shot up beginning in 2013, surpassing ""social media,"" which apparently is so first-half-of-the-decade: Trends come and go, and there are plenty of people questioning the near-term outlook for tech companies, but it’s amusing to look back on the proliferation and subsequent retrenchment of ""internet"" mentions circa 2000: Religious diversity is on the rise, but politically the weddings section is bluer than ever. One of the big themes of my previous analysis of the wedding announcements was the increase in ethnic diversity from the 1980s through today. That trend has continued, as encapsulated by more mentions of Hindu ceremonies alongside fewer Episcopalian ceremonies: There’s also a trend toward having friends officiate weddings, as evidenced by mentions of Universal Life ministers and American Marriage Ministries. I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a rejection of organized religion by the younger generation, but it does seem like reverends and rabbis have lost a bit of market share in the past decade: Politics is one area where announcements aren’t getting more diverse. Political party names show up in announcements when someone works for a campaign, or is a politician or the child of one. I noted last time around that Republican mentions actually outnumbered Democrat mentions in the early 1980s, but over the past decade the ratio has favored Democrats by a nearly 3-to-1 ratio: At least in the world of NYT weddings, peak Trump occurred in 2006. Upon closer inspection, about a quarter of all ""Trump"" mentions were actually for Donald’s sister Maryanne Trump Barry, who served as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and had a handful of clerks whose announcements made the weddings section. The NYT began publishing announcements for gay couples in 2002, some nine years before same-sex marriage was recognized by New York State. Initially, same-sex announcements used euphemistic phrases like ""affirmed their partnership"" and ""commitment ceremony"" instead of the traditional ""married"" language. But over time, and especially now that same-sex marriage is legal in the United States, same-sex announcements began to use the same language as opposite-sex announcements, so we see the euphemisms in decline: Since 2011, when New York state recognized same-sex marriage, same-sex couples account for about 10 percent of all announcements. Interestingly, men outnumber women by about 3 to 1 in same-sex announcements. A 2013 report from the Pew Research Center found that ""female-female marriages outnumbered male-male marriages in every reporting jurisdiction except New York City,"" so at least one plausible explanation for the same-sex gender imbalance in the NYT is that there are more gay men than gay women getting married in NYC. Another area in which men and women are not equal in the NYT weddings section: Latin honors. I’ve seen headlines before about how girls tend to do better in school than boys, and the weddings section supports the claim, as women graduate cum laude more often than men do: The trend holds for magna cum laude mentions as well, though the genders are pretty much equal for summa cum laude graduates. The NYT’s rules for submitting a wedding announcement specify that photos should include couples with ""their eyebrows on the same level and with their heads fairly close together."" Some friends of mine were recently featured in the weddings section despite a rather nonconforming photo, which, believe it or not, came up as a topic of conversation at the morning-after brunch. My contribution to the discussion was a promise to use the Wedding Crunchers database to determine the most conforming photo of all time. I ran every wedding photo through a face detection algorithm to extract coordinates for facial landmarks, then ranked the photos based on how level each couple's eyes and eyebrows were, plus how close together their heads were. Finally, we can all stop wondering: The most perfectly conforming NYT wedding photo of all time belongs to Tyler Davidson and Hilary Burt. Congratulations!

"There's a creed The Gunslinger lives by in ""The Dark Tower,"" and it ends with: ""You do not kill with your gun. He who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father. You kill with your heart."" Director Nikolaj Arcel and everyone at Sony should have thought about that meaning more when adapting Stephen King's eight-book series, because unlike The Gunslinger, they had no heart in their attempt to bring this classic to life. Done in a brisk 90 minute running time, the movie feels like a bunch of scenes cobbled together. With a disregard to character development, or even simply giving the audience a moment to breath in the world, the feeling of watching ""The Dark Tower"" is like racing through a meal because you are late to an appointment. At one point, I was imaging what it must have been like to edit this movie. Likely it was days filled with Sony Pictures head Tom Rothman standing over the editor screaming, ""IS IT DONE YET? IS IT DONE YET?? IS IT DONE YET!?!?!?"" The movie opens with teenager Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) having a nightmare that kids are being forced to be weapons for an evil Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) in his quest to destroy the Dark Tower, a giant black structure that goes high up in the sky. Seriously, that's all I know about it. The movie gives very little indication of its importance outside of it being very powerful. Gradually, we learn that Jake continues to have visions of The Man In Black and Roland Deschain/The Gunslinger (Idris Elba), while noticing that people around him seem to be strange creatures disguised as humans. Eventually, Jake's visions lead him to a portal to another dimension, and there he meets The Gunslinger. The two then go out to find the Dark Tower and also face The Man in Black. I never read the King books, but it's more than obvious Arcel and the slew of screenwriters who have taken on this project over the years — there are four credited, including Arcel — completely slaughtered King's material. Numerous supporting characters are given zero time for audiences to understand who they are and their importance in the story. And even more bizarre is the major power Jack has in the movie is actually a reference to another King book. About halfway through the movie, Jack discovers that he shines, which means he has psychic abilities. It's a power Danny Torrance possesses in King's novel, ""The Shining."" Though it's kind of cool that the movie makes a reference to another King classic, it's also very weird. In King's ""The Dark Tower"" books, Jack possess a similar power called ""The Touch."" Wouldn't it have made more sense to go with that? Fans of books like the movies they are based on to reference what's actually in them. It's hard to fault Elba or McConaughey for their performances. Whatever they were sold on to accomplish in this movie likely never panned out. Honestly, outside of some fish-out-of water comedy done by Elba when The Gunslinger transports to Earth briefly, there's nothing memorable about any performance. It's more than obvious Sony wasn't looking to really make a movie for the fans of the books — which is just plain bizarre. They are the ones who can't wait to see this! ""The Dark Tower"" turns out to be just the latest in a long line of movies based on King's books that are nothing like his work. The added problem with this one, however, is it's nowhere near close to being as good a standalone movie as most of those others.

"Open Thread is a daily feature where Waypoint staff talk about games and other things we find interesting. This is where you'll see us chat about movies, TV, and even sports, and welcome you to participate in the discussion. I love Christmas music. I know, a lot of it is grating and it’s been effectively weaponized by our Christmas, Inc. consumer culture, a sonic assault sent ahead of the credit card statements to force merriment and “Christmas Spirit” on people—of any and all beliefs—that find themselves in its path. If you’re feeling a bit blue this time of year, or if—like in my family—a lot of losses have attended this time of year, Christmas music can sound at best inappropriate and at worst positively mocking. And yet: starting around Thanksgiving I have an insatiable need to hear Frank Sinatra loving those J-I-N-G-L-E BELLS off an antique piece of vinyl with predictable, well-known scratches. John Denver  and The Muppets? Sign me right the fuck up. I just submit myself to the Boomer cultural hegemony around the holiday season, unironically enjoying Perry Fucking Como’s sentimental Christmas dirges, or Dean Martin sounding genuinely delighted to find himself in a “Marshmallow World”. But my  favorite music to listen to around this time of year is the music the leans all the way into the bittersweet nature of the holidays, and the sharp juxtapositions you get between personal struggle and public celebration. I’m the guy who, on Dec. 24th with the family gathered all around, is putting Low’s  Christmas on the CD player so we can all listen to the Gothic menace of “Long Way Around the Sea”. Or if I  really want to bring the eggnog and gift exchange to complete halt, I like to blast Stan Rogers’ “First Christmas” which always has a couple verses that leave me wrecked. The “non-traditional” song I probably look forward to the most is one of the hardest to find: Marcia Ball and Marian McPartland’s “Christmas Is Just Another Day”, which is just a great, sparse jazz song about feeling like you’re stuck on the outside looking in at rituals of the holidays.

" Porn star Nina Hartley faces the camera, her blond hair swept back in a ponytail, red-framed glasses perched on her nose. She's dressed like a gym teacher in white pants and a red track jacket zipped low enough to suggest she isn't wearing much underneath. She's standing in locker room, surrounded by senior citizens adjusting their retro gym clothes.   ""Contrary to what many of us think, sexual desire doesn't diminish with age,"" Harley says in her gentle lisp. ""In fact, it's one of the last functions people lose in their golden years. That's because today, thanks to advances in medicine, like the pharmaceuticals prescribed for erectile dysfunction, what used to look like this,"" here she holds up a small, browning banana, ""now looks a lot like this."" She holds up a significantly larger, firmer banana, while smiling cheekily at the camera.  Hartley, a 58-year-old veteran performer whose IMdB acting credits include  Anal Annie Just Can't Say No,  Rear Action Girls 2, and  Boogie Nights, has teamed with Pornhub to create  Nina Hartley's Old School: A Complete Guide to Safe Sex After 65. The campaign includes the aforementioned video, made to look like a vintage sex-ed film complete with atonal muzak and a grainy FBI copyright video at the beginning. The video is also available on VHS, and hard copies can be ordered by retirement homes and educational orgs, making the information accessible to tech-averse seniors.Over the course of 15 minutes, Hartley walks her audience through STI prevention and safe-sex practices, before directing them to an accompanying website that illustrates low-impact sex positions. Much of the campaign is wry and tongue and cheek—the cringey promo vid includes an elderly woman getting a ""GILF LIFE"" Ed Hardy–esque tramp stamp while rap music plays—but that doesn't mean it isn't 100 percent sincere. ""It's important that seniors are shown and seen as fully sexual individuals, worthy of privacy, pleasure, safety, and play,"" Hartley tells me over email. She graduated from San Francisco State University's nursing school in 1985, and her videos frequently combine the erotic with the educational regarding matters of sexual health. She first became aware that STIs were on the rise among seniors after reading a newspaper article several years ago but adds, ""It wasn't surprising, as people will always seek out connection, pleasure, intimacy, and good times. Age is no barrier to pleasure.""  ""There is a common misconception that people just stop being sexually active after a certain age, and that simply isn't the case,"" says Corey Price, VP of Pornhub. The adult video–streaming site had previously launched socially conscious initiatives such as awareness campaigns for domestic violence and described video for the visually impaired, but Price had long known he wanted to do something for senior citizens. ""It's so easy to find sex tips for millennials, who are often the core demographic for many of today's publications. But when you try and look for any information regarding the elderly, there just isn't much.""  An increase in life expectancy combined with a lack of risk for pregnancy means that more and more senior citizens are having unprotected sex. ""Between 2007 and 2011, the number of chlamydia infections in people over 65 rose by 31 percent, and syphilis by 52 percent"" says Hartley incredulously in the video to a sheepish looking audience. Infections that are inconvenient to a younger person can be fatal in an already weakened immune system.   ""With the launch of  Old School, we would like to garner more mainstream awareness about the importance of safe sex for today's seniors, particularly those in retirement communities and nursing homes,"" continues Price. The video is already gaining an audience since its launch [on July 17] and seems to be reaching some of the right people. As one comment on the video's Youtube page reads, ""Thank you Pornhub! I'll be careful from now on. I'm 85 and I still get a lot of vagina.""   Old School highlights just how vast the dearth of awareness is when it comes to the sexual practices of elderly people, especially those who require long-term assistant care. Adult children are frequently responsible for making significant life choices on behalf of aging relatives, and nobody wants to think of their sweet great aunt Beatrice getting spanked or eating ass. ""Most long-term care facilities do not have policies on sexual expression,"" says Dr. Melanie Davis, who launched safersex4seniors.org in 2012, a website run by health professionals that provides information on topics such as engaging in sex after prostate cancer, or coming out of the closet later in life. ""Adult children will often say, 'Well if my parent is in bad enough shape to need to be in long-term care, then they certainly cannot be having sex. That's just not appropriate.'"" Davis argues that a person doesn't stop being sexual just because their faculties have changed. It's often up to the daily caregivers, Davis says, to use their judgement about what's best for the patient on a case by case basis. That becomes more difficult when we treat all long-term care residents as asexual beings.  Davis recently spent the last few months field testing a sexuality education curriculum for older adults, which she plans to have available for sale early next year through a program called Our Whole Lives. It's a capstone in a series that starts in kindergarten with topics such as bodies and privacy, and runs through a lifetime of sexual experiences. ""When people think of sex ed, they tend to think of body parts fitting together,"" she says. ""When we talk about really comprehensive sexual education, it's about being in relationships and understanding yourself.""   It's also about learning to live to the extent one can in one's own body. ""One of my best, most enjoyable and fun sexual experiences was with a gentleman fan aged 90,"" Hartley emails me. ""We had the best time. He's only recently deceased, at age 99, but I'll always remember that night."" You can follow Anna Fitzpatrick on Twitter. ",finally-someone-is-teaching-old-people-how-to-fuck-good.txt,drew.uq

A blog dedicated to Fortnite news and related content pointed out Wednesday that many players have noticed large ""shooting stars"" falling across the sky while playing the game. The ""stars"" were first spotted a few days ago, according to Fortnite Intel, when they were much smaller and often hard to spot, but have been growing rapidly in size and frequency today. Here's what it looks like in the game now: As the ""shooting stars"" get closer and appear to come closer to the ground, more players have been referring to them as meteors. Many have started to speculate about what the meteors could signal for the game, and what the ramifications might be if one actually hits the ground. Within Fortnite, time is measured in ""Battle Royale Seasons,"" which last about three months. The game is in season three, scheduled to end on April 30, leading many to believe that the meteor could drastically change the Fortnite map with a fiery blast — in a similar way that the dinosaurs were wiped out — especially if it were to hit ""Tilted Towers,"" one of the most high-traffic metropolitan areas in the game, where the meteor has been spotted. Videos of the meteors have revealed an Easter-egg sound effect that is triggered by a player pointing directly at it, as demonstrated by Tyler ""Ninja"" Blevins, the most-followed Fortnite streamer on Twitch, saying ""IT IS THE END! IT IS COMING!"": Hardcore fans on Reddit and Twitter have even suggested that listening closely to the sound made by the meteor might convey a secret hint from the game developers at the fate of the meteor via Morse code, a theory that Ninja, who is a well-known consultant of the developers, showed interest in by retweeting: We'll know what these meteors mean for sure in the coming days.

"A version of this article originally appeared on Noisey Germany.  In Turkey, journalists at magazines critical of the government, like Cumhuriyet, are currently being thrown in prison. Authors are under constant surveillance, and since 2017 the number of academics who've been fired from their jobs in the public sector has risen to over 5,000. Under President Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish government has aggressively rescinded political rights and civil liberties, with media freedom sharply declining after a violent political coup in July 2016. According to Freedom House, Turkey's press freedom status is listed as ""not free,"" and the country's current ""Freedom in the World"" score is 32 out of 100 (zero being the least free, 100 being the most free).  But what's it like to be a musician in Turkey? Noisey spoke with Ozoyo, a DJ and producer in Istanbul, to find out. The 27 year old was born in Turkey, but lived in Germany with his family for eight years during his youth. He's been back in his home country for nearly ten years now, and lives in Istanbul as a musician and student. The music he makes is largely instrumental: Chill beats with hip-hop samples, with a hint of jazz and electronic music throughout this smooth sound. We asked him about the local music scene in Istanbul, what's its like to be an artist in Turkey's political climate, and his plans for the future.   Noisey: How would you describe your sound?   Ozoyo: The music I make is pretty laid-back. When I first started my music project as Ozoyo, I was listening to a lot of jazz. And I grew up with hip-hop. But I’m not someone who just gets stuck within one genre—I’m open to new sounds and enjoy getting experimental. The first two EPs were laid-back, but my next project is definitely going to be a little harder in terms of its sound.   What sort of influences inspire you? Everything I experience, everything I still want to experience, and everything that’s still waiting to cross my path. Might sound philosophical, but that’s the way I feel. I released my EP Wanderlust two years ago. Back then, I just wanted to travel but never had the time. So I decided to produce an EP that tells a story about traveling and the yearning for faraway places. If you take a close look at the track list, you can see what sort of trip I was imagining for myself.  From the protests in Gezi Park in 2013 to the attempted political coup in July 2016, all the way to the current imprisonment of artists and journalists who are critical of the government: The political landscape of Turkey has changed significantly in recent years. What is your impression of the current political climate in the country? The protests didn’t go unnoticed by me. At the Gezi protests in 2013, people initially gathered together to peacefully prevent the trees there from being cut down. Of course there were then groups who acted in a questionable way. But overall, it was about solidarity with a positive underlying idea: the preservation of something old, of the green spaces in the heart of the city in opposition to the construction of another large shopping center. It’s tragic that people wound up dying in the end.  To what degree have the living conditions in Istanbul changed for you?  My life hasn’t changed drastically, but you can see that the prices have risen rapidly. Everything is getting more expensive. The minimum wage is 1,400 Lira (roughly $350 USD) a month, and a beer in a typical bar costs about 15 Lira (close to $4 USD). Of course alcohol isn’t good for your health, but having fun is a privilege for the rich here. Even traveling has become difficult and expensive. First you need to get a passport, then you have to pay to get a visa, and on top of that you have a catastrophic currency exchange rate. For one dollar you’ve got to toss out nearly 4 Lira. That doesn’t leave much room for luxuries like vacation. But luckily, music allows me to travel in a different way. For a majority of the population that just isn’t possible, which is really too bad.  How have the political changes manifested in your daily life?Not a lot has changed in my personal, day-to-day life. I willingly moved back to Turkey with my family in 2008 after having spent eight years in Germany. But since I've come back, I've noticed that a lot of people are trying to move to Germany, England, or Austria. So I’m often asked why I came back [to Turkey]. I'm currently studying linguistics in Istanbul and I'll probably be done with my studies this year. Only once I’m finished with university will I know where I’ll be living.   What do you miss—any not miss—about Germany? What are the perks in your life in Turkey? Döner kebab tastes way better in Germany than in Turkey. That said, I’m not a big fan of the weather in Germany. But I really need to see more cities in Turkey and in Germany. Only then will I be able to form a solid opinion about both countries. I used to live in the Stuttgart region [in southwest Germany], and now I'm in Istanbul. But it’s difficult for me to make generalizations about people. Everyone grows up differently, here and there.   How would you describe the music scene in Istanbul? Like anywhere else, the scene is split up into different genres. Pop music, of course, sells the best. But there are a lot of people who are into less popular music. Thanks to Spotify, musicians here can show the world what they’re capable of. In terms of Istanbul specifically, I’m tight with all the hip-hop people, but also with the electronic community. I also prefer people who aren’t just all about partying, but who have a deep interest in music.  How easy is it to network with others in Istanbul? Just like anywhere else in the world, it’s easy to connect with other people through the internet. Through SoundCloud, Facebook, or Instagram, it’s easy to contact others and make connections that way. There’s a large community for electronic music here, but sadly most of them have gotten stuck in cliché genres like house and techno. That doesn’t mean I don’t like house or techno—on the contrary. I’d just find it better if others would be more open to different styles of electronic music. But still, there are small groups of people that are interested in subgenres of electro and other sounds. So then is there anywhere you’re even be able to perform your music?I’ve been getting booked for shows, yeah. Here in Istanbul I sometimes perform live and play [DJ sets]. Last year I performed in Berlin, Essen, and Munich, and this summer I’ll likely be performing somewhere in Berlin again.  Where do you like to perform the most?  Anywhere there’s music. When I’m in clubs, I play danceable music, from trap to house or techno. Sometimes there are events where I perform jazz or play only instrumental beats. A DJ and producer shouldn’t limit himself to just one genre, but rather be open to all sorts of music and then perform them. Your sound is awfully smooth. You’ve been working with more hip-hop samples recently and they have a pretty chill vibe. What inspired you to do so?Until now, my music has mirrored the quieter side of Istanbul. But my next project will show the darker sides of the city. My next EP is already finished. This time, there won’t just be simple loops, but also entire songs. I look forward to seeing how people respond to it.  Istanbul is a city of extreme contrasts. Not just because it’s split between Asia and Europe, but also because the districts represent contrasting poles—Fatih is very religious, Beyoglu is very open and liberal. How do you experience the contrasts there? Have the different fronts become hardened?  A lot of people came to Istanbul at the end of the 80s to work—people with various backgrounds and sexual orientations. Sometimes living together works quite well, other times not so much. Sometimes a woman will get harassed because she’s wearing a short skirt, and sometimes women who are completely veiled get made fun of by other people. Everywhere you go, people are good and bad at the same time. What keeps you in Turkey? What is it there that makes a difference for you? My studies, my family, and the amazing weather. Besides, you always find up discovering new and amazing little spots in Istanbul.  What projects are you currently working on? Are you collaborating with musicians from other countries?  Because I’ve been living in Istanbul for almost ten years, I can’t just travel anywhere at whim. Before I travel, I have to get a visa, that’s why most collaborations take place via the internet without me having to leave the place where I live. But aside from that, I currently have some collaborations with musicians from Germany and Turkey. I’ll be releasing my new EP in May or June. It’s a mix of trap and lo-fi jazz beats. Other than that, I’m still studying and will get my degree this year. And then hopefully I’ll continue to make music for a long time, travel around the world and get to know new, creative people.

"Voters in Illinois, Wisconsin, California, and Montana will be heading to the polls this summer and fall to make what should be an easy decision: neo-Nazi or not?  The candidates, all Republicans, are running various races in those four states — three for Congress and one for a state Legislature position. But they have one characteristic in common: Their views are openly white supremacist. Some even include limiting Jewish representation right in their political platforms or have the endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan. The wannabe politicians, however, have tough campaigns ahead of them. Only 9 percent of Americans believe holding white supremacist or neo-Nazi views is acceptable, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted shortly after the violence in Charlottesville.  That’s clear for Augustus Invictus, a Nazi candidate who ran for Florida Senate but dropped out because he couldn’t raise enough cash. He’s a white supremacist, Holocaust denier who once slaughtered a goat and drank its blood as part of a pagan ritual. He also headlined as a speaker at the violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Jones’ campaign website pushes a document called “The ‘Holocaust’ Racket,” in which he calls the genocide of 6 million Jews during World War II “the biggest, blackest lie in history.” Voters in Illinois, Wisconsin, California, and Montana will be heading to the polls this summer and fall to make what should be an easy decision: neo-Nazi or not?

But then again, he ran unopposed. “Even if only myself and my wife voted for me, I’d win the primary, because the Republican Party screwed up big-time,” Jones told the New York Times. This is Jones’ sixth run at the nomination, but this time the Republican Party just couldn’t get another candidate to oppose him. He’ll now be representing the GOP in November in a district that went Democrat in 24 of the last 25 elections.  Good luck with that, Arthur. Nehlen once tweeted that all Jewish people will burn in hell and once told the former leader of the KKK David Duke’s podcast that “Jews control the media.”  After campaigning for failed Senate candidate and accused child molester Roy Moore in Alabama, Nehlan’s now running to become the nominee to take Rep. Paul Ryan’s seat in Wisconsin. The next primary election is in August. Nehlen actually ran against Ryan once before, in Wisconsin’s last Republican primary in 2016 — and lost 85 percent to 15 percent. But not before receiving praise from President Donald Trump for supporting his presidency. At the time, Trump was facing criticism for his public fight with the Khans, the Muslim family of a Gold Star U.S. soldier killed in the Iraq War. Little self-identifies as a “white advocate” and is running for Senate in California. He’s currently outperforming fellow Republican contenders and has garnered the support of the KKK’s Duke.  Little’s platform includes: The California Republican Party has disavowed Little — They even kicked him out of the GOP convention. “There's no room for that kind of hate speech that that man uses,"" Cynthia Bryant, executive director of the California Republican Party, told the Los Angeles Times. Little’s primary is on June 5, and if he wins, he’ll be facing incumbent Democratic Dianne Feinstein in November. Abarr is all about diversity: In 2014, he tried to recruit black and LGBTQ people to the KKK, and now diversity is part of his platform as a candidate for the Montana state House of Representatives.  But Abarr apologized for all of that — mostly. “I am writing to apologize to the citizens of Montana for promoting bigotry and hate against minorities,” Abarr wrote on his campaign website. “First of all, I would like to say that the whole Montana KKK group was just a hoax promoted by me. I created this hoax to infuse fear in the LGBTQ community and racial minorities in Montana.” Still, Abarr’s campaign website includes a call for European Americans to be declared a protected class.  “There is widespread discrimination and hatred targeted at European Americans. There must be protections for us under the law,” his campaign website read. “Caucations [sic] should be able to publicly proclaim their ethnic identity and heritage in all institutions.” (The site spells caucasians incorrectly twice.)",its-2018-and-these-white-supremacists-are-running-for-office.txt,drew.uq
"WARSAW (Reuters) - An examiner was run over and killed by a 68-year-old woman taking her driving test in the southern Polish city of Rybnik on Monday, police said.  The 35-year-old examiner was run over by the candidate at an examination center during the part of the test focusing on maneuvers, Rybnik police said in a statement on their website.  “A 68-year-old woman, in circumstances which are unknown at the present time, hit the examiner, who unfortunately as a result of his injuries died at the scene,” deputy police commissioner Ryszard Czepczor told news channel TVP Info.  At the time of the accident, the examiner was probably testing another candidate, the police said.  Footage from TVP Info showed the red Toyota Yaris involved in the accident with its front bumper and number plate hanging off as it was loaded on to a truck.  “When we spoke to the woman she was in a state of shock and because of that speaking to her would be quite difficult,” Czepczor said.

"In the first footage discovered showing Marcel Proust, he speedily descends a staircase at a wedding. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads  In a recently discovered video showing Marcel Proust at a wedding, he descends a staircase unaccompanied, speedily walking past the slower couples to his right. It is the first footage we ostensibly have of the French writer (who appears at second 36). Jean-Pierre Sirois-Trahan, a professor of film and literature at Université Laval in Quebec, found the clip in researching the Canadian National Cinema Centre archives. Prior to this seconds-long moving portrait, we only had photographs of Proust, who generally appears slightly reclining, with pensive, heavy eyes, and a finger to his cheek. We could only ponder these images and animate his character with what we already knew of his reclusive, sensitive self. For him, photographs could not channel memory in the way “involuntary memories” could — a term he coined to describe when a sudden encounter in your day, like the taste of a madeleine cookie, causes a moment from your past to rush forth. A photograph, however, is limited by a single frame and is purely visual. At the same time, it gives you the time to linger over it. In The Guermantes Way, the narrator, in contemplating a photograph of the character Mme. de Guermantes, says it “allowed me for the first time to gaze at my leisure at that plump cheek, that arched neck, that tapering eyebrow (veiled from me hitherto by the swiftness of her passage, the bewilderment of my impressions, the imperfection of memory).” It is with swiftness and bewilderment that we observe Proust in this video, wearing a bowler hat and a pearl gray suit — two characteristic elements of his style that helped give way his identity. It is a bit jarring to see him move, almost sprightly, in the elite milieu he wrote about in his seven-volume series, In Search of Lost Time. In fact, he is attending the wedding of Élisabeth de Caraman-Chimay, whose mother was the inspiration for the Duchesse de Guermantes character. In a way, it is only apt that this video of Proust is an attempt, like his novels, to capture a fleeting moment. However, he made a point of distinguishing the two art forms, writing in Time Regained: “Some critics now liked to regard the novel as a sort of procession of things upon the screen of a cinematograph. This comparison is absurd. Nothing is further from what we have really perceived than the vision that the cinematograph presents.” Luc Fraisse, the director of the journal Revue d’études proustiennes that first published the discovery of the video, observed to the Guardian, “It’s moving to say to ourselves that we are the first to see Proust since his contemporaries.” Ninety-five years after the writer’s death, it feels as though we are instead met with a vision of him. Perhaps this is partly because it’s not a moment in time “we have really perceived.” As I watch and re-watch this seemingly banal moment of Proust walking down the stairs come and go, the video becomes as much about what has passed as what lies before my eyes.",the-only-known-film-footage-of-marcel-proust-or-proust-descending-a-staircase.txt,drew.uq

"Since the election of Donald Trump, there’s been a lot of discussion in medical circles about bringing a Silicon Valley ethos to drug innovation in America. This idea is embodied in Peter Thiel, the billionaire founder of PayPal, who has reportedly been helping the president vet a pool of candidates to lead the Food and Drug Administration. Thiel, a libertarian iconoclast, has repeatedly made the case that the FDA gets in the way of drug innovation by making it too difficult for new medicines to get to the market. Some of the FDA candidates he’s identified — including Silicon Valley’s Jim O’Neill and Balaji Srinivasan — have similarly argued that the agency should dump its requirement that drugs be proven effective before reaching the market, and that we’d be better off if the FDA operated more like a “Yelp for drugs.” In other words, bringing the same speedy and disruptive approach to medical regulation that Silicon Valley brought to the taxi and hotel industries, for example, will unlock cures — fast. But Thiel and his pals miss a very important point about developing new drugs: Manipulating biology isn’t the same as manipulating computer code. It’s much, much harder. Speeding up medical innovation will take a lot more than just stripping down the FDA — it’ll take huge leaps forward in our understanding of biochemistry and the body. Health care is also different from taxis and hotels in another key way: Consumers can’t really judge the safety and quality of medical products by themselves. One of the key notions that undergirds the Peter Thiel view of the FDA is that if the agency just got rid of some of the pesky restrictions for drug approval, we’d usher in another golden age in drug development. (Thiel declined our interview request.) To test this idea, I asked a longtime pharmaceutical scientist (and conservative), Derek Lowe, for his views. In his 28 years in the lab, Lowe has seen hundreds of thousands of compounds tested on a huge variety of drug targets, and never, not once, has he brought a drug to market. The reason? “We don’t know how to find drugs that work,” he said. For every 5,000 compounds discovered at this ""preclinical"" phase of drug development, only about five are promising enough to be tried in humans. That’s a success rate of 0.1 percent. Drug innovation comes from painstaking tinkering and a dash of luck. “It’s very tempting for someone who has come out of IT to say, ‘DNA is code, and cells are the hardware; go in and debug it’,” Lowe said. “But this is wrong.” In Silicon Valley, humans have designed the hardware, software, and computer code they’re working with. In medical research, scientists do not have that advantage, Lowe said. “We have 3 billion years of spaghetti-tangled gibberish to deal with. And unless you’ve done [drug development], it’s very hard to get across how hard it is. I don’t know of anything that’s harder.” Biochemistry and cell biology are “like alien nanotechnology,” he added. So the real hurdle researchers face when it comes to finding new drugs for people isn’t overcoming a stringent regulator; it’s grappling with that “alien nanotechnology” in the lab. Thiel has argued that the clinical trials required to prove a drug is effective slow down the development process. In one talk, he said that if we didn’t force drugmakers to prove their products are better than the others already available, we’d have more “slightly worse, but much cheaper” options to pick from. To address this, he and other regulation skeptics typically suggest that the FDA should loosen up, or even get rid of, its efficacy requirement. Let’s step back a bit to explain how the FDA approves drugs, and the three phases of clinical testing they have to pass to get the final green light. In phase one trials, researchers test drugs for safety in a small group of healthy people, and tinker with dosing. In phase two, they test the drug in a larger group of people and make sure it delivers on its promise by monitoring how well it works against the best available therapies or a placebo. In phase three, the drug is tested on an even bigger group (up to 3,000 people), and again, researchers compare how the drug works against other treatments on the market and carefully analyze safety data. If the drug makes it through phase three, the data is submitted to the FDA for approval. Folks in the Thiel camp argue that removing the efficacy requirements — or abolishing phase two and three clinical trials — would give consumers more drug options. And they’re right on that point: If drugmakers only had to prove their drugs were safe, there would certainly be many more products on the market. But would they be good drugs? Consider this. It wasn’t until 1962 that the Food and Drug Administration starting asking drug companies to prove their products were both safe and effective before they hit the market. Until that time, there were some standards related to adulteration and labeling, but otherwise it was mostly a free-for-all. It took the infamous scandal around thalidomide, a morning-sickness medication that caused severe birth defects, to strengthen the FDA ... and incidentally, the FDA’s efficacy standard coincided with the golden age of drug innovation in the 1970s and ’80s. The failure rate for drugs in clinical trials is about 90 percent. That means the vast majority of drugs aren’t safe or effective enough to be used — they don’t do what they were supposed to do. As Yale FDA researcher Joe Ross noted to me, “If there is no demonstration of a benefit, does it matter if we have more options?” And here’s Lowe: “The clinical failure rate is not 90 percent because the FDA are such bastards. The clinical failure rate is that high because most drugs don’t do what we thought they were going to do.” It’s precisely the clinical trial process, with scientists closely measuring efficacy, that helps weed out drugs that don’t work. Unlike hotels or taxi services, which can easily be evaluated by consumers, consumers often can’t judge whether their drugs are helping or hurting them: The effects may not be obvious or appear for a very long time. “It’s not like when you pick up a car and drive it and decide whether you like it or not,” said Hank Greely, director of the Center for Law and the Biosciences at Stanford. “Knowing whether drugs are safe and work is something far beyond the common knowledge of patients, and is frankly far beyond the knowledge of most physicians.” Greely pointed out that we already have an example of what a much less regulated drug world would look like: “It’s called the nutritional supplement industry. And it’s a travesty.” Supplement makers don't need to demonstrate that their products are effective or even safe before putting them on store shelves — so most supplements are unproven, and problems with quality and adulteration appear to be distressingly common. In the 1980s and ’90s, Congress and the FDA created several programs to speed up the development and approval process for new pharmaceuticals: the orphan drug designation, priority review, fast track, and accelerated approval. These programs were intended to push the most clinically important, innovative drugs — medicines to treat rare, serious, or life-threatening diseases — out to patients more quickly, often on the basis of more limited and less rigorous clinical trial data. “These pathways along with increased funding for FDA drug reviews from user fees enacted first in 1992 were successful,” said Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in an email. “The average total review time, for example, has fallen from 30 months in the 1980s to currently around 8.5 months.” But the more important question is whether expedited FDA pathways increased the number of innovative new therapeutic options for patients — and here the data is far less clear. “Some transformative drugs, like imatinib (Gleevec) for chronic myeloid leukemia, have definitely benefited from speedier FDA pathways,” Kesselheim said. But research continues to show that the majority of drugs that have come onto the market offer little or no improvement over the status quo. For example, several studies have found that since the mid-1990s, about 85 to 90 percent of new drugs that have come onto the market don't offer any clinical advantages for patients compared with existing therapies. More worryingly, the special expedited development and approval pathways have become the rule, rather than the exception. Newer research, led by Kesselheim in the BMJ, looked at a database of all new medicines approved by the FDA between 1987 and 2013 and found that over the past two decades, the proportion of new drugs qualifying for at least one of the FDA's expedited programs has increased by 2.4 percent per year. Kesselheim and his colleagues also concluded that ""this trend is being driven by drugs that are not first in class and thus potentially less innovative."" So there's little evidence that speeding up approval times has helped spur innovation. Some even argue that if you want to bolster medical innovation, you need to look well beyond the FDA. Yale’s Ross says some of the biggest barriers occur in the world of insurance payers. “Medicare essentially pays for almost everything [the] FDA approves. If payers were making more coverage decisions — including reimbursing more effective, safer medications — based on value, that would be a huge incentive to innovate better products,” he says. Before descending on the agency, Silicon Valley types will also need a firmer grasp of the history of medical regulation and why it’s there in the first place. Peter Thiel has said, ""You would not be able to invent the polio vaccine today,” echoing similar statements from some of the potential FDA picks. Yale medical historian Jason Schwartz disagreed: “This assertion is at best ahistorical, if not altogether meaningless.” The famous Salk polio vaccine trial in 1954 involved more than half a million children, “a number that would be unacceptable today,” Schwartz explained. And shortly after the vaccine’s introduction, problems with its production resulted in the Cutter Incident: Vaccines with live polio virus (instead of killed virus) were administered to thousands of American children, sickening 40,000, leaving 200 paralyzed, and killing 10. Over the past half-century, we’ve seen a number of new vaccines come onto the market, including shots to prevent hepatitis B and meningococcal, which were developed without harming children. “It's exactly the production safeguards and ongoing oversight of vaccines and other products by the FDA today — both before and after approval — that keep these kinds of preventable tragedies from happening again,” Schwartz said. Now that we’ve gone through the reasons Silicon Valley types are misguided, let’s talk about the places where they could really shake up the FDA for the better. Alex Tabarrok, over at Marginal Revolution, argues that the FDA needs to better adapt to the new world of personal technologies that can empower patients. As he wrote on his blog: Today almost everyone carries in their pocket the processing power of a 1990s supercomputer. Smartphones equipped with sensors can monitor blood pressure, perform ECGs and even analyze DNA. Other devices being developed or available include contact lens that can track glucose levels and eye pressure, devices for monitoring and analyzing gait in real time and head bands that monitor and even adjust your brain waves. And several of the FDA commissioner candidates would be well positioned to help the agency work through how to safely integrate these technologies into clinical trial research and patient care. “[FDA commissioner candidate] Joseph Gulfo has experience in getting devices through the FDA process, including the remarkable Melafind, a device for spotting melanomas,” Tabarrok said in an email. “Balaji Srinivasan [another FDA candidate] started a genetics testing company so they have experience in this area.” Mark McClellan, an FDA commissioner under George W. Bush, agreed. He told us he’d like to see the FDA enable innovators to use technologies like electronic medical records, mobile phones, and remote sensing to automatically collect medical data from patients or find potential enrollees for clinical trials. “The big opportunity for time savings is not in FDA review time,” McClellan said. “It’s in the entire development process that leads up to the review — how to design clinical trials, how to enroll patients in them.” Drug approvals in cancer therapeutics is another area several observers said could radically be improved. Dr. Vincent DeVita, an oncologist and former head of the National Cancer Institute, wants to see cancer centers initiate and run early-stage clinical trials instead of the status quo (which involves the agency signing off on the trials first, adding time and cost to the process). The FDA also requires researchers to test drugs separately — but a lot of cancer treatments right now involve treating patients with combination therapies — so here, too, the FDA lags the pace of oncologic drug innovation. But he also said, “I think [these issues] are unique to cancer.” Whoever gets appointed, DeVita said he’s not holding his breath for a big shake up. “I went through five FDA commissioners [while working in government], and not one of them had a major impact on drug development,” he says. It’s the midlevel staff at the agency that often wields the most influence, he added. A “Yelp for drugs,” sponsored by the government, is a long way off.",peter-thiel-vs-the-fda.txt,drew.uq
"Michael Bloomberg is eyeing a third-party run for president this fall, calling the election season so far an ""insult to voters"" and saying the public deserves ""a lot better,"" according to a Financial Times report. At the end of January, the 73-year-old former New York City mayor and gun control advocate reportedly told his advisors to gauge the viability of a 2016 presidential run. The idea was he'd be willing to spend as much as $1 billion of his fortune on the potential campaign against the financial juggernauts in both parties, but this is the first time Bloomberg has spoken directly about the plan. The media magnate has considered throwing his hat in the presidential ring in the past, apparently testing the waters during the 2008 election before shelving the idea after deciding he couldn't win. This time around, it's legit to wonder if an independent might have a decent shot doing the moderate thing with populists Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders making noise in both major party primaries. The former mayor has set himself an early March deadline to decide one way or another, the Financial Times reports. That way, he would probably have enough time to get his name on ballots around the country in time for November.",michael-bloomberg-is-seriously-considering-a-presidential-run.txt,drew.uq
"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO and Russia did not make significant progress on saving the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in talks at the alliance headquarters on Friday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.  Barring a last-minute decision by Russia to destroy a new medium-range missile that NATO says violates the INF, the United States is set to pull out of the accord on Aug. 2, arguing that it needs to develop its own warheads to deter Moscow.  Moscow says it is fully compliant with the INF treaty negotiated by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which eliminated the medium-range missile arsenals of the world’s two biggest nuclear powers.  “We have not seen any signs of a breakthrough,” Stoltenberg told reporters after a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council, a closed-door forum that allows for dialogue between the two sides’ diplomats and officials.  Stoltenberg said the chances of a resolution were “going down, day by day” but that NATO had not given up on trying to convince Moscow to destroy the SSC-8 ground-launched cruise missile, which it says the treaty ban on land-based missiles with a range of 500 km to 5,500 km (300-3,400 miles).   The breakdown of the treaty, the latest in a growing list of East-West tensions, is of grave concern because medium-range rockets would allow Russia to launch a nuclear attack on Europe at very short notice, Western experts and officials say.

"During their first spring semester, students create an original digital short story as both author and artist. The results are on display at the annual show Digital Short Story: Small Bytes / Big Fiction, at SVA’s Flatiron Gallery.  Founded in 2013, the MFA Visual Narrative program at the School of Visual Arts places equal importance on creative writing and visual expression, a combination rarely found in academia. The flexible low-residency program is supported by a curriculum designed to accommodate students who are working, with three eight-week summer sessions in New York City that bookend online-only classes for two academic years. During their first spring semester, students create an original digital short story as both author and artist. The results are on display at the annual show Digital Short Story: Small Bytes / Big Fiction, at SVA’s Flatiron Gallery. Among the wide variety of stories are a reimagined tale from the Bible that viewers navigate via an app, a dark, gritty narrative of contemporary adolescence and an action-packed sci-fi saga. Each is displayed on an iPad in the exhibition alongside related physical artifacts and posters, and can be found online at mfavn.sva.edu. The show was curated by faculty members Jim Rugg and Mark Sable, who helped plan the original curriculum. Like most of the faculty, they have separate careers that inform the coursework — Rugg is a writer and illustrator and Sable is a screenwriter and author. “This group of students demonstrated a shared value in design,” says Rugg. “They also maintained a high-level of spontaneity throughout the process that made each weekly project update exciting.” Digital Short Story: Small Bytes / Big Fiction SVA’s Flatiron Gallery 133/141 West 21 Street, NYC On view through June 11 A reception will be held on Friday, June 3 from 6-8pm.

"Harvey Weinstein is now in the crosshairs of federal prosecutors who are looking to possibly prosecute him under a law that some legal experts say is a giant stretch. Law enforcement sources tell us, the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York is looking to see if Weinstein violated the Mann Act. It now prohibits people from taking others across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal sexual acts. The law was initially designed to prevent adults from transporting minors across state lines for sex. The law requires the suspect to have formed the intent to commit the act before taking the victim across state lines. Our sources say prosecutors are looking at at least one actress whom Weinstein flew from one state to another. The stretch is that they will have to prove he asked the actress to travel, knowing that he was going to rape her when she arrived at the destination. The difficulty in such a case ... Weinstein may have wanted to have sex, but didn't assume from the get-go he would have to rape the woman. As we reported, Weinstein will turn himself in today on state sexual assault charges. Weinstein has maintained the sexual encounters he has had were all consensual.",harvey-weinstein-prosecutors-eyeing-obscure-law-in-investigation.txt,drew.uq

"Welcome to VICE Sports Q&A, where we talk to authors, directors, and other interesting people about interesting sports things. Think of it as a podcast, only with words on a screen instead of noises in your earbuds. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length. From 1992 to 1997, MaliVai Washington was a reliable top-40 player on the ATP Tour who was nonetheless overshadowed by other U.S. players such as Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Michael Chang, and Jim Courier. Still, for two weeks in 1996, Washington was the talk of the tennis world. That year, he defeated American Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals after trailing 5-1 in the fifth set and became the first African-American man to advance to the tournament's final since Arthur Ashe became the first black man to win there 21 years earlier. Washington lost his match in straight sets to Richard Krajicek, and persistent knee injuries forced him to retire three years later, at age 30. Regardless, Washington made a mark in a sport that has had few African-American stars, and no black man from the U.S. has made a Grand Slam final since his Wimbledon run two decades ago. Washington, 47, now lives in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, where he owns a real estate company and helps run the nonprofit MaliVai Washington Kids Foundation, which he founded in 1994. He has been honored for his work off the court with the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year award from the ATP Tour in 2009 and the NJTL Founders' Service Award last year from the USTA last year. Washington spoke with VICE Sports on Friday morning about his career, 1996 Wimbledon, the state of American men's tennis today, and more. What do you see in the players now that you didn't see in your time? Do you think the guys you played with could compete with the guys nowadays?  What I see is players who are getting bigger, both on the men's and women's side, in terms of height. It just seems when I was playing, 5-11, 6-feet for the men was a good size. Now you have a lot of women who are 5-11, 6-feet. I think the tallest player on the men's side is 6-11. You have Milos Raonic in the [Wimbledon] semifinal right now, he's probably 6-9-ish. [Editor's note: He's 6-foot-5]. You have a lot more players who are bigger and taller, but they don't seem to be sacrificing their movement around the court. I think I see that in other sports, as well. I think I see it in basketball. I see it football. The players are getting bigger and stronger, but they're still just as agile and as quick and fast. Is that just because of training, the way they're able to train better than before? It seems that with technology and nutrition, everything in tennis is more of a science today than it ever was. What I mean by that is players who are able to track everything they're doing from their training to their nutrition to their heart rate to how much water they're drinking, how they're feeling. They're tracking it very detailed. That carries over into match analysis. There are some players who have access to hundreds and hundreds of matches of different players. It's getting very much like baseball. I feel in baseball, there is a statistic on every single possible thing you can think of. It's not left to chance. In baseball, this is a pitcher's most likely pitch when it's a 2-2 count. In tennis, it's very similar. It's getting to the point where on break point down, this is a player's tendency. A lot of times, you don't know what a player's going to do, but if you have a good idea of what their tendencies are, that can be the small edge that you need to win a match. Back when you were playing, the technology wasn't there like it is today.  When I was playing, the majority of the scouting was sitting in the stands watching your opponent, or my coach watching my opponent. I had a VCR at home and I would record on VHS tapes matches of players and I would analyze that. In this day and age, you can go on the internet and pull up a guy's match and look up at the statistics and look at his first serve percentage and look at his tendencies. You can do that from a computer in your hotel room. Technology has advanced the game, I'll say. Did you feel good going into the 1996 Wimbledon? Did you feel you were playing well and could make a deep run? Ironically, for whatever reason, I never had a lot of success at Wimbledon prior to '96, though I thought my game should play well on grass. I did have success at other tournaments leading into Wimbledon over the years, but never had success at Wimbledon. I can't really say I felt this huge rush of confidence going into '96 Wimbledon, but you take it one match at a time. As I started progressing through the first week, certainly my confidence was growing. When certain players started falling out of the draw, it was going to be an opportunity for someone to break through and get deep into the second week. In the quarterfinals, you played Alex Radulescu and won a five-setter. What do you remember about that match? It was a grueling five-set match and it was against a quality player. It's one of those matches where I think I went in feeling like I should win the match, but three hours in, you find yourself in a dogfight trying to get to your first [Grand Slam] semifinal. And he's trying to get to his first semifinal. I just remember it just being a dogfight out there. When you were trailing 5-1 in the fifth set in the semifinals against Todd Martin, was there any doubt in your mind? Were you getting nervous there? I jokingly say at 5-1 down, I strategically planned it and that's exactly where I wanted him. Jokingly, I say that. You never plan on being down 5-1. When I'm in the semifinals of Wimbledon, at no point are you about to throw in the towel. The only time you throw in the towel is when you have just lost the last point and you're shaking hands. Then you can give up and say, 'OK, I'm done. I lost.' Prior to that, you're in the semifinals of Wimbledon. You're never going to give up. You're never going to stop trying and stop pushing. I mean, this is the semifinals of Wimbledon. This is the pinnacle, one match away from the biggest match of your career. You're not gonna give up just because you're down 5-1. As I've said many times, I'm not sure why it turned around. Certainly Todd got tight and he could feel the nerves because he was also trying to reach his first Wimbledon final. I just kept saying to myself, 'Whatever you do, just make him play. See if he has the guts to finish the match.' That's what I advise all players to do. Just because you're down, you never want to just start giving away points in games and give away the match because that makes it very easy for your opponent. You really want to see if they have the guts and the mental capacity and the nerves to finish out the match. I just kept telling myself, 'Make him play, just make him play. Don't give him anything.' Lo and behold, I just started clawing my way back into the match. At some point there, the crowd started getting a little bit more boisterous and they were wanting to see more tennis and they were witnessing this big comeback. It was a very special moment for me. The match was suspended by rain four times. Once you won that last point, you must have been thrilled. It was a very tiring match, [I was] just very fatigued. With all of the rain delays, you walk off the court and you don't know if you're gonna be off the court for 30 minutes or three hours. You can't really let your guard down. You're trying to relax, but you're also trying to stay loose and you want to stay prepared because there'll be a point where an official will come into the locker room and say, 'Hey, we're walking out in less than ten minutes.' You're trying to stay mentally and physically prepared to go out at anytime. Once that match was over, it was a thrill. It was the greatest win of my career and the greatest moment of my career up to that point. To come out with a victory was phenomenal. It's the moment that I've always cherished. What was it like heading into the final against Krajicek? Was there a lot of attention for being the first African-American to make the final since Arthur Ashe? I think when you're in the semifinals and final of Wimbledon, there is a lot of attention around you when you're on the grounds of Wimbledon. There was a lot of attention when I was walking to the practice court and trying to practice, just a lot of people around. It certainly wasn't something I was used to, to that degree, but that's where I think it's important to have the right people around you. I had my brother [Mashiska] there who was supporting me and helping me the entire tournament and just keeping things in perspective for me. Even though there is a lot more attention and a lot more press and a lot more people and a lot more autograph seekers, really you're there to do one thing, and that's to win a tennis match. That was my focus going into the final, doing everything I could to prepare and win a tennis match. Do you look back and think Krajicek was just the better player in the final? Was there anything you think you could've done differently? On that particular day, he was the better player. I give him credit for going out under the same pressures I had. He played a better match than I did. I'd say it's as simple as that. In moments like that, it comes down to execution on big points and the player who can control their nerves and also play good tennis throughout. Not great tennis, not the best tennis of your life, but success comes down to the player who can play good, quality tennis. I wasn't able to match his quality. Being linked to Arthur Ashe and being the first African-American man to make a Grand Slam final since him, was that special for you? Afterward, it was special, certainly, but during Wimbledon, that wasn't my primary thought. Certainly there were many people in the press who brought up that fact, that I was the first African-American to be in the quarterfinals since Arthur, the semifinals since Arthur, the final since Arthur. It was fact, but I wasn't really thinking about the historical value of what was going on. I was just thinking, 'How do I win a tennis match?' Really, it was up to tennis fans to think about the historical value. Now, after the match and after my career, I can certainly think back and look favorably upon that and say that that was a great accomplishment. I would've liked to have done one better and won Wimbledon. That would've been very, very special, but it wasn't meant to be. Did you know Arthur at all? Was he someone you looked up to? I didn't know him as a friend or didn't know him closely but had the opportunity to speak with him on two different occasions. I really admired him as a person and certainly as a player. I've always said I admired more about what he was able to do off of the tennis court with his notoriety. He, unlike most players, chose to use his platform for social justice or to create awareness for different illnesses or create awareness for social issues around the world, whether it be apartheid or something else. Not very many athletes in the history of any sport have put their name out there on the front line and stood and walked on the front line for causes, especially as vocally as he did. Not everyone can do that. Not everyone feels comfortable doing that. But that's what I admired most about Arthur. Is there a tennis component to your foundation? Our foundation is really a three-part program. It's not an athletic program. It's not a tennis program. It's really a three-part program that consists of tennis, life skills, and education. With those three impacting our students every single week, we've created a program that allows young people to excel. When they're in our programs, they not only excel, but they succeed. Regardless of what their economic situation is at home, regardless of what their family situation is, it allows them to succeed. So much in life, all we want is a chance. So much in life is not given to us, but if we're given the chance to succeed, we can really show what we can do. With our students, if they're given the chance to succeed, which they are, then they can really show us and the world what they can do. It seems like your parents gave you and your siblings that chance [sisters, Micheala and Mashona, and brother, Mashiska, played professional tennis]. Are you grateful for that? First and foremost, I would say that my parents set a great example for us. My parents are still married to this day. Fifty-six years, I think they've been married. They were two college-educated individuals who worked hard day after day after day. That is one thing that they instilled in us. If it's one thing I could say, the overriding thing that they instilled in us was the value of hard work and being willing to put in the time if you want to succeed. If you think about it, if every parent was able to instill that in their kids, the value of hard work and being willing to put in the time to succeed, how much more success would we see in the world today? I'm grateful to them for everything they did for me and my brothers and my sisters, not only for our tennis careers but for setting an example of 'this is how you raise kids', 'this is how you parent your kids', 'this is how you set an example for your kids to follow'. That's what I try to do today with my two kids, who are 13 and 11. When you were growing up, there were a lot of great young American players: Michael Chang, Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Jim Courier. Do you have any memories of playing them in junior tennis?  I played Andre when we were in 12-and-unders in San Diego, California. I played Pete Sampras in 14-and-unders in Shreveport, Louisiana. I played Michael Chang in Dallas, Texas, in 18-and-unders. These were guys I grew up with playing and rooming with, in some cases, in tournaments and at tennis academies. It was kind of interesting because all of them chose to go pro early and forgo college and I chose to go to college [at the University of Michigan for two years]. It was always an inspiration to me, a driving motivation for me when I saw the success that Chang, Agassi and Courier were all having on Tour as professionals knowing that just one, two, three years prior, these were the players I was competing against at tournaments and beating. That was a motivation for me when I was in college. Were you satisfied with the way things turned out in your pro career?  I'm happy with my career. I'm not satisfied with my career. There were things I wanted to accomplish and did not, but I'm happy that I think I took my God-given ability and I didn't squander it. I think I worked my butt off day after day to try to become the best player I could. I reaped the rewards of that. I think there's always part of you that looks back and says, 'What if?' But I try to look at it from both sides of the coin. What if I hadn't gotten injured? Could I have had the career I wanted and achieve some of the things that I wanted to achieve? But the other side of that is, What if I had gotten injured one year into my professional career and I stayed on Tour for two years? I've always been one to appreciate what I was able to achieve. American men's tennis hasn't gone as well since your era. Do you have any thoughts on the reasons for the drought? I don't have a good answer for you. The USTA doesn't have a good answer for you. But this is something that every tennis federation goes through. I'd say for American men's tennis, the heyday was in the 1990s, without question. We're going through a rough patch in American tennis right now if the goal is to produce Grand Slam champions, the last one being Andy Roddick in 2003 [at the US Open]. We have quality players playing at a high level. Sam Querrey just showed that this tournament at Wimbledon [defeating No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic in the third round and advancing to the quarterfinals]. But we haven't been able to produce those Grand Slam champions. I know a lot of time, effort and money is being spent to do that. It just hasn't worked. But every country goes through that at some point. Look at Australia, look at Spain, look at Sweden, they're struggling with the same challenges the USA is struggling with right now. And then go figure, a small country like Serbia has the No. 1 player in the world [in Djokovic]. Sometimes logic doesn't always explain what goes on or can explain it. James Blake had a good career, but it doesn't seem like tennis has caught on in the African-American community. Why did you think that is? Does more outreach need to be done?  I think part of it comes down to a numbers game. The overwhelming number of African-American athletes here in the United States gravitate towards football and basketball. Millions of young black boys gravitate towards basketball and football. Consequently, where do most black athletes excel? Basketball and football. Look at any NFL team or any NBA team, that's where they excel. If here in the United States we had hundreds and hundreds of thousands of young black boys and girls gravitating towards tennis, let's say, or gravitating towards golf, guess what? You would see more success at every level of junior, college and pro in those sports.. I don't know what would change those numbers dramatically because I think basketball and football will always be very popular sports. I don't know what's gonna change the trend. I hope the sport continues to get more and more players of all races – black, Hispanic, Asian, white players. I hope it continues to get a more and more diverse group of American players that succeed. But even when you do that, there's no guarantee you're going to get players that are going to go win Grand Slams. One of the toughest things in the world to do is go win a major. Just because you have a lot of players playing doesn't mean it's going to happen. I think it'll happen eventually, but I don't know if you're gonna have an American man win a major next year or ten years from now. I just don't know. And then you see someone like Serena Williams winning more than 20. Are you amazed at how the Williams sisters have been able to do so well in the last 15-20 years? I'm proud of what they've been able to accomplish, and I'm amazed at it. What they've been able to accomplish, regardless of their race—just take their race out of it. What they've been able to accomplish as two sisters is absolutely phenomenal. Certainly people acknowledge it, but I don't know if anyone truly has written about or given them the credit for the success that that one family has. I'm thinking of sports, and I'm going back 50 years, and I can only think of a couple of family members that have had this type of success. In baseball, you had the Bonds, Barry and his dad [Bobby]. I'm sure there's a few more that are skipping my mind that I can't think of right now. In basketball right now, Klay Thompson with the Golden State Warriors, his brother [Trayce] plays for the Dodgers. These are two Hall of Famers, Venus and Serena. Serena looks like she might finish her career being the best ever and Venus is gonna finish her career being one of the best ever. And to think that comes out of one family, that's not something that is gonna happen for the next 100 years. It's never happened before. I don't know what would make you think it's gonna happen in the next generation or two. That's how special and rare and unique and fascinating their accomplishments are. Do you coach or play tennis anymore? I still play tennis. I do not coach tennis. I don't have a desire to be out on the court hours a day teaching tennis or even getting out on the road for weeks and weeks a year coaching a player. That's not where I think my skills are or my interest level is. Do you compete in any tournaments anymore or just play for fun? It's probably been a good four or five years since I've played any [senior tournaments]. Once I retired, I never had a big desire to go out and compete at the senior level or compete at senior Wimbledon. For whatever reason, that wasn't a big interest of mine.

"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads LOS ANGELES — Sweetie. Pushy Broad. Sheela Na Gig. Queen. Sapphic Poon Hustler. These are just a few of the thousand or so terms used to describe women featured in Betty Tompkins’s sprawling painting installation, WOMEN Words, Phrases, and Stories, on view at Gavlak Gallery in Hollywood — her first solo show on the West Coast. Along three walls of the gallery’s back room, 1,000 canvases of various sizes from tiny to medium are arranged in a carefully arranged — if seemingly random — pattern. Onto each one, in a neutral, sans serif, all-caps font, Tompkins has painted a word or phrase that describes a woman, from the degrading to the reverential. These thousand terms come from a larger list of 3,500 submissions that she received in response to two requests sent to her entire email list — the first in 2002 and a second in 2013. The four most common words were the same each time: “bitch,” “slut,” “cunt,” and “mother.” And these are from people in the supposedly progressive art world, not your usual internet trolls. The project has been shown in Greece, Berlin, and recently at New York’s Flag Art Foundation, where participants were invited to read the words aloud, letting them contribute their own interpretations and adding a performative aspect. The 70-year-old painter is currently enjoying something of a second act, after emerging from decades of semi-obscurity in 2002 with an exhibition of her Fuck painting series at the Mitchell Algus Gallery in New York. Between 1969 and 1974, Tompkins painted blown-up and cropped monochrome images sourced from pornography, coolly rendered with an airbrush. When I sat down with Tompkins last month, shortly before the opening of her Gavlak show — where more recent examples of these works are also on view — she explained to me that their origin was her extreme boredom with just about everything she was seeing in New York galleries. “I couldn’t stand to look at them. I go, ‘Jesus Christ, you just went through this gallery building in under a half an hour, and these guys must have spent two years doing these paintings.’ I couldn’t make myself stay,” she says. Her husband at the time, artist Don Tompkins, had a collection of pornography that he had ordered from Asia, skirting US obscenity laws by having the material mailed to a post office box in Canada, and then crossing the border to retrieve it. “I was looking at them one day and thinking, you know, if you take off the head, and the hands, and the feet, all the identifiers, then what you have left is something really beautiful in an abstract way, plus it has this tremendous kick as subject matter,” she told Susan Silas in a 2012 interview. “So that’s why I decided to do it.” Tompkins had already switched to a mechanical method of paint application in graduate school, in an attempt to strip away from her work everything that she was comfortable with, was good at, or enjoyed. “I had really loved working with a brush. I loved the bounce off the canvas, such a physical pleasure to me,” she told me. “So I had to give up the brush, and I picked up spray guns.” The Fuck paintings are striking and unapologetic, turning the male gaze on its head, as if asking the viewer, “Is this what you want to see?” Tompkins took lustful images that were then solely meant for men’s eyes and democratized them, rendering them dispassionately, and transforming them for her own ends. Begun at the end of the ’60s, they both reflect and prefigure much of the contemporary art movements of the time, from Pop to Seriality, from Feminist Art to the Pictures Generation. Writing for Flash Art last year, William J. Simmons opined, “ … Tompkins deserves to be positioned as both a pioneer of sexually progressive work, but also of formally replete engagements with appropriation, photorealism, and abstraction.” The reaction to the work at the time was less than encouraging, however, met with either indifference or hostility. “All the dealers said, ‘Come back in 10 years when you’ve found you voice.’ About half would look at me and say, ‘Don’t come back then either; we don’t show women,’” she says. Tompkins had experienced similar sexism as a student when a professor remarked, “honey, the only way you’re going to make it in New York is on your back.” She pleaded with her husband to submit slides of her work to galleries as his own, with simply the name “B. Tompkins” written on them, but he refused, fearing for his university teaching job. Despite being rejected and ignored, or perhaps because of it, Tompkins did not feel a sense of failure. “Nobody had any expectations for me. I had no expectations outside of what I do. So that, in fact, is very liberating.” Commercial success was elusive, although she did make it into a 1975 show at the Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston curated by a then fledgling curator named Paul Schimmel — now a partner in LA powerhouse art space Hauser, Wirth & Schimmel — who had been a student of Tompkins’s when he was in high school. “That was crazy because I had never shown anywhere, and then there I was in this museum exhibit,” she recalled. The feminist component of these works is now widely appreciated, but at the time, other artists who considered themselves feminists did not look kindly on her appropriation of pornography. “They had never been welcoming to me,” she recalled. “It was before the internet and email. People were calling each other up, but I was never invited to a meeting.” She sent her work to Paris in 1973 for a gallery show, but it was seized at French customs on obscenity grounds. (Ironic coming from the country that birthed Courbet’s “The Origin of the World.”) It took a year for her to get the paintings back. “They kept being rejected on both sides,” Tompkins said. “It gave me this image that my paintings would go back and forth over the Atlantic Ocean for eternity, while I was never going anywhere!” Tompkins carefully unstretched and rolled up her Fuck paintings, storing them in her apartment for decades until showing them again in the early 2000s. Language started creeping into her work after this episode, with “Censored” drawings, explicit images over which Tompkins laid a grid, stamping “censored” on the offending areas. “I censored my own pieces. I felt I could do it better than anyone,” Tompkins told me. “It was in reality a way to stay sane. Being censored is a really nasty business.” In her next series, text took over the works completely. “I got really interested just in language from reading reviews of first wave conceptual work, which I in no way understood. The critical language frustrated me so much that I would regularly throw my Artforums against the wall,” she said. “Critics were saying, ‘I read this work as …, ’  so I took one of my cow photos and I drew a grid and wrote the word ‘cow’ in each square.” WOMEN Words, Phrases, and Stories takes this very orderly approach to language and explodes it all over the walls with a vibrant energy. The backgrounds of these canvases are painted in a range of styles, often parodying prominent male painters. “One of the advantages with this series is that I can do anything I want with the paint. I felt really free,” Tompkins told me. “I started studying some of the old boys, de Kooning and the [Abstract Expressionist] group. We’re raised to think of these guys as tortured souls, but my feeling is they were having a lot of fun.” On the surface, this new series may seem very different from her work of almost 50 years ago that roused so much scorn. But for Tompkins, they share a through line that has connected her work through periods of obscurity and recognition. “I like things that are out in the world already. One of the things that I was attracted to in using porn as a source was that it already existed,” she said. ”This language was already out in the world. It was kind enough that people sent it to me, so that I could put it back in the world in a different format, but none of these worlds are mine. They were gifts to me.” Betty Tompkins: Sex Works / WOMEN Words, Phrases, and Stories continues at Gavlak Gallery (1034 N.

"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif rejected a U.S. warning against carrying out space vehicle launches and missile tests, saying on Thursday they did not violate a U.N. resolution.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a pre-emptive warning to Iran earlier on Thursday against pursuing three planned space rocket launches that it said would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution because they use ballistic missile technology.  “Iran’s launch of space vehicles - & missile tests - are NOT in violation of (Resolution) 2231.

"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines’ Globe Telecom Inc on Thursday launched Southeast Asia’s first 5G broadband service, with embattled Huawei Technologies Co Ltd providing the equipment, a win for the Chinese firm despite cybersecurity worries from Western nations.  The telecoms firm aims to offer high-speed internet to tens of thousands of homes and offices in key urban centers as part of its $1.2 billion capital spending this year, Alberto de Larrazabal, Globe’s chief commercial officer, told reporters.  Globe would use Huawei’s equipment like radios and modems to deliver 5G quality broadband internet, he added. Huawei and Finland’s Nokia were Globe’s equipment providers for its 4G service.  The United States had warned that next-generation 5G equipment, which some telecoms experts see as more vulnerable to attack than previous technology, could be exploited by the Chinese government for spying if supplied by Huawei, which the company denies.  Washington, a treaty ally of Manila, had persuaded governments and telecoms operators to shun Huawei, the world’s largest maker of telecommunications equipment.  Globe hired independent firms “to ensure that our security protocols are up to date, to make sure privacy and security issues are addressed,” de Larrazabal said.  Philippine consumers, the world’s top social media users, often get frustrated with slow and choppy internet connections. The Philippines’ mobile internet and fixed broadband speeds lag behind its neighbors, data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index showed.  It ranks 107th among 178 countries in terms of fixed broadband speed at 19.55 megabits per second (Mbps) versus the global average of 59.6 Mbps. Among 140 countries, it ranks 107th in terms of mobile internet speed at 15.10 Mbps, nearly half of the 27.22 Mbps global average.

"Nearly three dozen small to mid-sized earthquakes have rocked northern Oklahoma towns since Wednesday, rattling windows and nerves in a region where scientists have linked seismic activity to oil wells. The quakes included a magnitude 4.4 and a magnitude 4.8 that struck about two miles apart and within a minute of each other Wednesday night, the US Geological Survey (USGS) reported. They kept going into Friday, with two 4.0s on Thursday and a 4.1 on Friday morning. At least 15 more were in the 3 range — and all were centered within a few miles of each other, in a patch of prairie about 100 miles northwest of Oklahoma City, according to the USGS. Wednesday night's quakes were the first ""that really made me nervous,"" said Paul Southwick, the city manager of Fairview, Oklahoma, about 20 miles southeast of the quakes' epicenters. ""It started out with a rumble and then it got louder and louder and louder,"" Southwick said. ""Then I felt this wave go under the house. The house lifted and went down and started shaking. I could feel it with my feet on the floor until it was just about gone, and then we got hit with another one."" 'It's the first time we've seen three magnitude 4s in less than 24 hours, and all three in the same area.' Nearly three dozen small to mid-sized earthquakes have rocked northern Oklahoma towns since Wednesday, rattling windows and nerves in a region where scientists have linked seismic activity to oil wells. The quakes included a magnitude 4.4 and a magnitude 4.8 that struck about two miles apart and within a minute of each other Wednesday night, the US Geological Survey (USGS) reported.

I could feel it with my feet on the floor until it was just about gone, and then we got hit with another one."" 'It's the first time we've seen three magnitude 4s in less than 24 hours, and all three in the same area.' More than 25 people reported feeling Wednesday night's quakes as far away as Kansas City, Missouri, nearly 350 miles away, according the USGS. Before Wednesday night, there had been four or five noticeable recent quakes in the area, Woods County Sheriff's Deputy William Barnum said. ""We've had quite a few of them lately. This one just shook a little longer,"" said Barnum, who lives in Waynoka, about 20 miles west of where the quake cluster was centered. ""In my house, it shook my chair and shook the windows."" In less than a decade, Oklahoma has gone from having one or two small earthquakes a year to nearly three a day. The Sooner State saw more than 900 quakes of magnitude 3.0 or above in 2015, with 29 of them in the 4-range, said Jeremy Boak, the head of the Oklahoma Geological Survey. ""It's the first time we've seen three magnitude 4s in less than 24 hours, and all three in the same area,"" Boak said. ""And those come on the heels of two that were only two days apart."" Scientists say the seismic surge stems from the salty wastewater that gets pumped up from oil wells in the petroleum-rich state, separated from crude oil, and shot back deep underground, where it lubricates the faults that crisscross the state. There are no injection wells operating in the immediate vicinity of the Fairview-area quakes, said Matt Skinner, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates the oil industry — but go about 30 miles further out, and there are a lot of them. ""That region has seen an enormous increase in disposal activity over the past couple of years,"" Skinner said. And most of those wells handle high volumes of wastewater, he said. Related: Welcome to Quakelahoma State officials have responded to previous quake swarms by ordering wastewater injection wells in nearby areas to reduce their depth or volumes — most recently around the Oklahoma City suburb of Edmond, which was hit with a magnitude 4.2 quake on January 1. Skinner said some action would be taken in response to the latest quakes, but officials are still studying what to do. Boak said state seismologists put Wednesday night's biggest quake at 4.6 instead of the 4.8 that the USGS recorded. But he said seismic activity in the area has grown sharply as more oil companies have begun drilling there. ""That's on the edge of an area that has been slowly but steadily lighting up more and more over a larger and larger area,"" Boak said. ""I'm presuming that's partly about the development of this particular play out there."" The oil and gas industry is the bedrock of Oklahoma's economy, and the industry has argued that there's not enough evidence to blame the quakes on injection wells. But even the petro-friendly state government has said it considers the issue settled, even if industry critics say their recognition came too late. Even small quakes have been adding up to big bills for some homeowners, most of whom don't have earthquake insurance. And for others, the quakes are starting to give them the creeps. ""We've felt some others, but again, not to this intensity,"" Southwick said. ""This was to that level that really wakes you up and you say, 'What are we getting into here? Are we going to have something that's going to be worse?' This is concerning.""  Related: A Big Earthquake Just Hit Oklahoma — And It Might Be the Oil Industry's Fault Follow Matt Smith on Twitter: @mattsmithatl",oilrich-oklahoma-has-been--hit-by-nearly-three-dozen-earthquakes-since-wednesday.txt,drew.uq
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke in a prerecorded video to thousands of anti-abortion activists in Washington on Friday for the 46th March for Life, vowing to veto any legislation that “weakens the protection of human life.”  The event is the largest annual gathering in the United States of opponents of the Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade. That ruling found that certain state laws outlawing abortion were an unconstitutional violation of a woman’s right to privacy, effectively legalizing abortion nationwide.  “I will always defend the first right in our Declaration of Independence, the right to life,” Trump said in remarks recorded in the Oval Office, a right he said extended to “unborn children.”   Vice President Mike Pence appeared onstage at the rally to introduce the video, calling Trump, who before entering politics said he supported abortion access, “the most pro-life president in American history.”   During his 2016 campaign, Trump vowed to appoint Supreme Court justices he believed would overturn Roe. He has since appointed two justices to the court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, cementing the court’s 6-3 conservative majority.  Since the heated Senate confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh, the court has steered clear of some cases on volatile social issues, including abortion.  Marchers trudged through muddy slush on the National Mall holding signs saying “Pray to End Abortion,” “My unexpected pregnancy is now 30!” and calling for the federal defunding of Planned Parenthood, a national healthcare provider that offers abortions as well as birth control and cancer screenings.  One marcher said she had had an abortion at the age of 17 but had been opposed to abortion ever since she became religious.  “No matter how you look at it, it’s taking a life and it’s wrong,” said Marcy Blunier, a 57-year-old real estate broker from New Mexico.  A circle of women bowed their heads in prayer as they waited to start the march down Constitution Avenue to the Supreme Court. Two men navigated the crowd hauling a large wooden cross.   Supporters of abortion access say bans infringe on women’s rights and health, and lead to greater rates of injury and death among pregnant women.  About half of U.S. adults say abortion should be legal, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll last year, with about 68 percent of Democrats supporting abortion access compared with about 31 percent of Republicans.  The anti-abortion march comes a day before thousands of women descend on Washington for their third march opposing Trump’s presidency.

"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Despite promising a decade ago to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, the world’s leading economies more than doubled subsidies to coal-fired power plants over three years, putting climate goals at risk, energy researchers said Tuesday.  Between 2014 and 2017, G20 governments more than halved direct support for coal mining, from $22 billion to about $10 billion on average each year, according to a report by the London-based Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a think tank.  But over the same period they boosted backing for coal-fired power plants - particularly supporting construction of the plants in other, often poorer nations - from $17 billion to $47 billion a year, the report noted.  China and Japan - which will host a G20 summit later this week in Osaka - were the biggest providers of public finance for coal-fired power, followed by South Korea and India, it said.   While spending from national budgets on coal fell, as did tax breaks for it, other forms of support - from development finance institutions, export-credit agencies and state-owned enterprises - soared, the report said.  “You can see they’re pretty much exporting the dirty energy systems to countries in much earlier stages of their development,” said Ipek Gencsu, a researcher at ODI and a lead author of the report.  Those include nations such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam, she said, where foreign backing for coal power is slowing adoption of cleaner renewable energy systems and locking in dirty energy and air pollution risks.  To meet an internationally agreed goal of holding rising global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, coal power will need to be phased out between 2030 and 2050, according to the Powering Past Coal Alliance.  That alliance, formed in 2017 and led by the British and Canadian governments, includes 30 countries as well as businesses and other organizations committed to switching to clean energy as rapidly as possible to meet climate goals.  Coal currently provides about 40 percent of the world’s electricity, according to the alliance.  Because new coal-fired power plants have a life of about 40 years, over which their costs must be paid back to investors, building new coal plants could lock countries into using them beyond the needed phase-out of coal, energy experts say.  “They’re heading toward a car crash,” Gencsu predicted, with taxpayers in countries that accept new coal plants likely to foot the bill for bailing out investors if the plants are shut early to meet climate goals.  About $3 billion a year in support by G20 governments for coal aims to ease the pain at home of the transition away from the fuel, through measures such as helping workers retrain or rehabilitating closed coal mine sites, according to the ODI report.  But governments are also helping support coal companies that are no longer financially viable, often to ensure a stable baseline of power to complement fluctuating renewable energies such as wind and solar, Gencsu said.  Coal subsidies also continue in many places because of powerful coal lobbies - or because politicians prefer to delay decisions that could have political consequences, she said.  Ilan Kelman, a researcher on sustainability and energy issues at University College London, said that “the people who receive the subsidies may have a lot of influence on the politicians who give them the subsidies”.  Also, quickly slashing subsidies without easing the burden on people’s budgets can lead to political unrest, as France found out last year when it raised fuel taxes, spurring the “yellow vest” protest movement, Kelman said.  Globally, direct fossil fuel subsidies were $427 billion last year, according to the International Energy Agency.  Indirect fossil fuel subsidies  - including things like costs to health systems from air pollution and fossil fuel spill cleanups - were estimated at $5.2 trillion a year in 2017, according to an International Monetary Fund working report.  Gencsu said that to hold the line on climate change, governments, development banks and other bodies supporting coal “need to be much braver and come to grips with the reality of the climate emergency - and make policy decisions very soon.”  Reporting by Laurie Goering ; editing by Zoe Tabary: Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.

"Aly Raisman and her Team USA teammates are heroically disrupting a dangerous belief system that athletes must blindly trust their coaches and doctors -- so says fellow Olympian Adam Rippon.

""I think when you're an athlete and you have somebody who's in power, you feel like they're in the right,"" Rippon says. ""You're in that position where you wanna listen to them. You want to do everything that they tell you to do, even if it sounds wrong. You still do it because that's what you're told. You want to be the best."" Obviously, it was that mentality that explains why so many girls and young women stayed quiet about the abuse they suffered at the hands of team doctor Larry Nassar, who sexually assaulted more than 180 women under the guise of performing medical techniques. ""There were people [like Larry Nassar] that really took advantage of that.

"While most Americans were preparing for a long July 4th weekend, Aaron Regunberg, a policy adviser to Rhode Island Mayor Jorge Elorza, was getting arrested outside an ICE detention center in Providence. That was by design.  Leading liberal politicians like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been slammed for conflating migrant detention centers with concentration camps, but a growing number of American Jews like Regunberg are pushing back with a message of their own: Yes, they're concentration camps, and we must stop them now. Invoking the Holocaust, they have been protesting outside ICE detention centers across the country, chanting ""Never Again for Anyone."" “Never Again isn’t just about remembering how the Holocaust ended. It’s also about how it started, with a gradual process of legal exclusion and state-sponsored dehumanization that led eventually to the deaths of my grandpa’s family and so many millions of others,” Rugenberg, whose relatives were murdered in the Holocaust, said at the protests in Providence last week. In the last two weeks alone, thousands of Jews, young and old, have turned up outside ICE facilities in Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities chanting “Never Again Means Now” and “Close the Camps.” As of this writing, more than 120 have been arrested. If the movement has its way, they’ll soon be joined by hundreds more. ""As mostly white or white-passing Jews, we feel obligated to make heightened risk the baseline of what we are doing,” Sophie Ellman-Golan, one of the organizers of Never Again Action, told VICE News.

""As mostly white or white-passing Jews, we feel obligated to make heightened risk the baseline of what we are doing,” Sophie Ellman-Golan, one of the organizers of Never Again Action, told VICE News. The movement was inspired by a Facebook post by Serena Adlerstein, a granddaughter of Holocaust survivors who works with Movimiento Cosecha, an organization led by and for undocumented immigrants. Adlerstein posed the question, “What would I have done if I were alive during the Holocaust?”  “Most Jews are conscious to the experience of refugees and immigrants. It’s so recent in our history. It’s clear which side our community should be on.” The response turned into the first action on June 30, when over 100 Jewish protesters gathered in front of an ICE detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and tried to block employees from entering. Eventually 36 were arrested and charged with obstructing public passage. The next day, 2,000 American Jews expressed interest online in taking similar actions in their city. Then on July 2, 1,000 Jews in Boston and a few hundred in Providence did similar location-specific anti-ICE actions, with 18 arrested in each place. More protests followed on July 4 in Philadelphia, resulting in 33 arrests. On July 5, nearly 500 protested outside Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office building in San Francisco with the message “Close the camps or we will close your office.” Demonstrations continued this week in Chicago, D.C. and Buffalo, New York.  “Most Jews are conscious to the experience of refugees and immigrants. It’s so recent in our history. It’s clear which side our community should be on,” said Alyssa Rubin, one of the organizers, who is also active with IfNotNow, a network of Jewish activists calling for an end to U.S. support for Israeli occupation. “It’s important to show up as Jews because, with our connection to the Holocaust, we have a stake and a moral authority.”  This willingness to draw direct parallels to the Holocaust has become a central tenet of the movement. While prominent American Jewish institutions like the Anti-Defamation League, The Jewish Community Relations Council and the American Jewish Committee rejected Ocasio-Cortez’s use of the term “concentration camps,” Never Again Action has embraced it.  They’re drawing headlines and national attention because of it.  “The Jewish community definitely has the ability to pull the heartstrings of people, and we’re seeing a shift of public opinion,” said Catalina Santiago, 22, a community organizer with Movimiento Cosecha, who was at the protest in Boston. She says there has never been a partnership on this scale before. “It’s been really powerful for Never Again Action to verbalize solidarity with communities being terrorized every day. They are popularizing the outrage on this issue and the demand for protection of immigrants.” Read: These Photos Show What It’s Like at Overcrowded Border Patrol Stations The movement’s GoFundMe page has already raised $180,000 in 10 days to pay for legal fees, with leftover money going to Cosecha, which has been protesting ICE since the Obama era. Meanwhile, their acts of civil disobedience at key ICE facilities across the country is helping keep outrage over the issue front and center, applying pressure on leading centrist Democrats to speak out. This week, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer called on the Trump administration to ""clean house"" at Customs and Border Protection. ""The top people at CBP ought to be fired,"" he said.  “The Jewish community definitely has the ability to pull the heartstrings of people, and we’re seeing a shift of public opinion.”  Never Again Action may already mark the most significant wave of American Jewish activism in decades, said James Loeffler, professor of modern Jewish history at the University of Virginia. “Since World War II American Jews have taken to the streets in large numbers twice: once to fight for civil rights and once to free Soviet Jews,” Loeffler says. “The first we did as Americans who happened to be Jewish, the second as Jews who happened to be American. Now, we are seeing activists who seek to emphasize their braided identity as both Jews and Americans,” he said. The movement’s sudden rise to national prominence is impressive, but it didn’t happen in a vacuum.  Jewish outrage has been steadily growing since Trump took office in 2017. Jews have watched as Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists,” described African and Caribbean nations as “shithole” countries, said there were “very fine people on both sides” after neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville chanting “Jews will not replace us,” and directly targeted Muslims and refugees with hostile rhetoric. They’ve worried over the staggering rise of white nationalist speech and explicitly anti-Semitic hate crimes. And they’ve shown up to protests: at airports in the early aftermath of Trump’s Muslim Ban, at the national mall during the Women’s March, and in Pittsburgh, after the massacre of 11 Jews in in the Tree of Life Synagogue in October.  Read: U.N. Human Rights Chief “Appalled” by Conditions of Child Detention at U.S. Border But all of this seems to have crystallized into this current moment, provoking wide swaths of mostly young Jews to not just join actions but also lead them.  “We are seeing an overlap of anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic rhetoric,” said Ellman-Golan, one of the organizers. “We have seen how the [George] Soros conspiracy theory targeting thousands of immigrants has led to Jews being murdered. There is deep outrage.”  Nearly every day, people are turning out to protest in their cities, big and small, with actions planned this weekend in Michigan and New Hampshire. Organizers are planning a large action in D.C. on Tuesday, July 16. The pressing questions now are: Where are these protests headed and will they create broader action outside left-leaning Jewish circles? Thus far, aside from J Street, most major American Jewish organizations that normally influence Washington’s position on these issues have been noticeably quiet. While resolutely condemning conditions at the border and calling for an end to detention of asylum-seekers, immigration is not a core issue for them, and they do not appear to be taking institutional action. (The AJC did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The ADL, meanwhile, said that they “don’t have much to say about these actions.”) “There is deep outrage”  Rubin, from Never Again Action, said the Jewish mainstream condemned Ocasio-Cortez’s comments almost more forcefully than the detention centers themselves.  “If they truly felt these camps are concentration camps, they might put a little more institutional force behind pressuring Congress to do something more drastic,” she said.  Their inaction, however, has opened the door for other parts of the Jewish community to take the lead. “I think they’ve ceded the mic to us,” she added.

"Brian Sandoval, the moderate Republican governor of Nevada who also happens to have been a federal judge before becoming governor, has been floated by both of his home state's senators as a possible compromise Supreme Court appointment. The White House is apparently taking the idea seriously enough to have commenced some formal vetting to see if there's some big reason other than the obvious partisan politics angles not to do this. But then there are the obvious partisan political angles. If literally everything about American politics in 2016 were different, filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the death of an iconic conservative justice with a moderate Republican could be a sensible compromise between a Democratic White House and a Republican Senate. But in the actual politics of 2016 it seems so obviously doomed as to be hardly worth trying — though floating Sandoval's name in the press as a way to bait Republicans into batting it down could be a savvy strategy for Democrats to underscore exactly how rigid the GOP is being about the confirmation battle. More importantly, while Sandoval does not seem like the right person for the current situation, the situation will almost certainly change and Democrats on Capitol Hill, though well-aware that the base doesn't like the idea, tell me it's a possibility that should be taken seriously. If, for example, Hillary Clinton wins in November but Republicans maintain control of the Senate the Sandoval Option could start to look like a timely solution. The Nevada governor is a Republican and, as such, a generally reliable conservative on a range of issues. But as the governor of a politically moderate state that had a Democratic controlled legislature for parts of his tenure, he has taken a number of noteworthy moderate positions: Sandoval also has an interesting long-term relationship with frenemy Harry Reid, the Democrats' leader in the Senate. Way back in 2004 when Sandoval was attorney general, Reid recommended him to the Bush administration as a Republican he would gladly back for a seat on the federal judiciary. Sandoval got the nod from Bush for a seat on a federal district court, and the affair was generally interpreted in the press as an example of Reid's political savvy — by putting the young, popular Sandoval on the federal bench he eliminated him as a potential Reid opponent in his 2004 reelection battle. But then in 2009, Sandoval resigned his seat on the bench to run for statewide office. Not against Reid (who ended up narrowly defeating weak opponent Sharron Angle) but against Reid's son, Rory, chair of Clark County's county commission. Notwithstanding the family drama, Reid and Sandoval have often been allies on Nevada-specific issues, fighting against nuclear waste storage at Yucca Mountain and for the construction of Tesla's Gigafactory battery manufacturing facilities. As a politician who is also a former federal judge, Sandoval is more qualified for a Supreme Court seat than the typical elected official who gets floated. And as a moderate Republican, he is ideologically positioned between Barack Obama and the GOP Senate leadership, which seems like the kind of thing you would want from a compromise candidate. What's more, in a practical sense whether or not Obama can get a nominee confirmed comes down to whether or not he can get moderate Republicans to back his choice. A moderate Republican might fit the bill. The basic calculus leading to a compromise would be risk aversion. Sandoval is considerably more conservative than most Democrats, but distinctly to the left of Justice Scalia. Seating him on the bench would increase the number of cases that liberals win. In particular, it would hedge against the risk that a Republican wins in 2016 and manages to replace both Scalia and Ginsburg with conservative jurists — essentially eliminating the ""swing vote"" status of Justice Anthony Kennedy. Conversely, for Republicans, putting Sandoval on the bench would foreclose the possibility that Democrats take the White House and the Senate in November, fill the seat with a liberal, and launch the first progressive majority on the Supreme Court in two generations. Just imagine Obama announced tomorrow that he was nominating a pro-choice Republican to fill Scalia's seat. Ted Cruz would denounce it, of course, and so would Donald Trump. Marco Rubio would follow suit, as would the House Freedom Caucus. Bernie Sanders would denounce it too, and so would Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren. A handful of cross-pressured senators like Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) would likely praise the gesture as bipartisanship, but they'd be a distinct minority and any hope for a deal would swiftly collapse. There's much more to the Supreme Court than abortion, but the anti-abortion movement is the emotional core of conservative activism on judicial issues. On the Democratic side of the aisle, filling the seat with a moderate Republican might actually be worse from the standpoint of labor unions who are currently looking forward to a tie on the Friedrichs case. What's more, the idea of Obama being forced to name a Republican touches the emotional core of the Democratic base — the idea that Republican obstructionism is an effort to delegitimize Obama and his presidency. Political leaks are almost never genuine leaks. Usually when something like this gets in the press it's because the key decision-makers want it to get in the press. Floating a Sandoval trial balloon in order to induce Republicans to freak out preemptively is a nice way of demonstrating to America's political journalists that Senate Republicans are not currently interested in compromise. Obama leaking that he's vetting Sandoval makes sense. Actually nominating him seems like a crazy play. That would be a good way to lay the groundwork for the nomination of a solid progressive. Republicans will, obviously, block a solidly progressive nominee which will lead to some criticism of Obama for not making a more conciliatory choice. The Sandoval leak helps establish that conciliation might not work. Imagine the Supreme Court vacancy lingers through the November election, and when all the votes are counted Hillary Clinton is president-elect but Republicans still hold a majority of Senate seats. Now everyone's hopes and dreams will have been frustrated and there will still be a need to do something about that Supreme Court vacancy. Suddenly a pro-choice Republican governor with a fairly conservative record but also a history of compromise and deal-making looks like a pretty reasonable compromise choice.",why-obama-is-vetting-nevadas-republican-governor-for-the-supreme-court.txt,drew.uq
"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is considering nominating Oklahoma oil and gas mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary if elected to the White House on Nov. 8, according to four sources close to Trump’s campaign.  The chief executive of Continental Resources (CLR.N) would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the oil and gas industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trump’s pro-drilling energy platform.   Dan Eberhart, an oil investor and Republican financier, said he had been told by officials in Trump’s campaign that Hamm, who has been an informal advisor to Trump on energy policy since at least May, was “the leading contender” for the position.   Eberhart said he had discussed the possible appointment with  top donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, where Trump was formally nominated as the party’s candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Three other sources close to the Trump campaign confirmed Trump was considering Hamm for the post. One of the sources said he first heard that Hamm was a contender from Trump officials on Sunday. None of the sources was aware of who else Trump may be considering for the job.  Representatives for Trump and Hamm did not respond to a request for comment.   Addressing the convention on Wednesday night, Hamm called for expanded drilling and said too much environmental regulation    threatened to limit U.S. oil production and increase the country’s dependence on Middle Eastern oil producers.  “Every time we can’t drill a well in America, terrorism is being funded,” Hamm told the cheering crowd. “Every onerous regulation puts American lives at risk.”      Hamm, 70, became one of America’s wealthiest men during the U.S. oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade, tapping into new hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in North Dakota’s shale fields.  Past heads of the U.S. Department of Energy, which is charged with advancing U.S. energy security and technology and dealing with nuclear waste disposal, have typically boasted a political or academic background.  This is not the first time Hamm has been in contention for the job.  The Republican Party’s presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, vetted Hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind.   He made headlines in 2015 after settling a protracted divorce case and agreeing to pay his ex-wife $975 million - reported to be the biggest divorce settlement in history. His fortune is now estimated at nearly $12 billion.    “FRACKER-IN-CHIEF”  Trump, who has yet to make any announcements about his prospective cabinet, has already surrounded himself with strong advocates of traditional energy sources like oil, gas, and coal and has promised to gut environmental regulations to boost drilling and mining if elected.  He tapped U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a climate skeptic and drilling advocate, to help draw up his campaign energy platform, and picked Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also a climate skeptic, as his running mate.   Both moves cheered the energy industry but alarmed environmental activists who say a Trump presidency would set back years of progress on issues like pollution and climate change.   “Given that Hamm’s as close as we’ve got to a fracker-in-chief in this country, it would be an apropos pick for a president who thinks global warming is a hoax manufactured by the Chinese,” said leading environmental activist Bill McKibben.   Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has promised to bolster regulation and increase use of renewable fuels to combat climate change if elected.

"COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh — “My mother was killed after the military set my home and village on fire,” 8-year-old Yasmin Noor said.

The United Nations has since described the campaign as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing,” with the organization’s human rights chief telling reporters Tuesday he could not rule out “elements of genocide.” Some 625,000 Rohingya have converged on the small fishing village of Cox’s Bazar since August. Sixty percent of them are children, according to UNICEF. There had already been some 200,000 Rohingya refugees living in the border village before September’s massive influx.

In fact, there are thousands of children who have arrived to these mud-soaked camps alone — having lost both parents to violence, or separated along the way. A recent survey by UNHCR found that 5,677 (3.3 percent) of Rohingya refugee households in Cox’s Bazar were headed by children. More than 4,800 households, or 2.8 percent, include children who have been separated from their families or remain unaccompanied. Each day, there’s increased risk that these unaccompanied children will become victims of sexual abuse or forced into the slave trade, warned the United Nations migration agency in a recent report. “We are sitting on a time bomb. If we don’t keep reacting, it could explode at any moment. They need water, shelter, food, obviously, medicine and nutrition,” said Jean-Jacques Simon, chief of communication at UNICEF Bangladesh told VICE News.

"When we think of X-rays, we generally think of the human body’s skeletal structure, but in the 1930s, one osteopathist turned his attention to the anatomy of plants and used his X-ray machine as what it fundamentally exists as: a camera. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads When we think of X-rays, we generally think of the human body’s skeletal structure. But in the 1930s, one osteopathist turned his attention to the anatomy of plants and used his X-ray machine as what it fundamentally exists as: a camera. Dr. Dain L. Tasker, then head radiologist at Los Angeles’s Wilshire Hospital, cultivated a hobby of photographing individual flowers using X-ray film, resulting in beautiful black-and-white prints that highlight the graceful lines of plant forms with incredible detail. What began as a doctor’s experiments in marrying science and art yielded a collection of hundreds of striking botanical images, a selection of which are now on view in Floral Studies, an exhibition at San Diego’s Joseph Bellows Gallery. “Flowers are the expression of the love life of plants,” Tasker wrote of his photographs, as former curator and art historian Bonnie Yochelson recounts in her introduction to a monograph of his images. The poetry and beauty he saw in botany is evident in his minimal compositions: dark and diaphanous, each plant Tasker photographed stretches the length of the surface of each print. All parts are illuminated and completely exposed: we can clearly see the layers of petals that form the cup of a tulip and the carpels usually concealed in a lily’s bell, now gossamer as if lightly sketched. In one radiograph, a philodendron rises tall, curving like the flame of a candle; in another, Tasker has captured a lotus from above so its petals splay like a gaping eye, with an iris surrounded by eyelashes of filaments. There is nothing difficult about taking such images, Tasker apparently noted, with the only requirements being “an abiding patience” and a knowledge of “flowers and their habits.” Still, he struggled at first to produce proper prints from his X-ray negatives. Initially an amateur photographer of landscapes and portraits, Tasker first started exploring the artistic possibilities of radiology after seeing an X-ray photograph of an amaryllis taken by a physicist he knew. With no formal training in photography but desiring to better his techniques, Tasker reached out to Will Connell, who was then teaching photography at Art Center College of Design. In addition to supervising Tasker’s printing processes, Connell also helped the doctor’s works go on display at the 1931 and 1932 annual salons organized by the Camera Pictorialists of Los Angeles as well as at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. Tasker’s radiographs eventually made their way into national photography magazines, from US Camera’s October 1939 issue to Popular Photography’s March 1942 issue. Other prints he gave as gifts to his nursing students upon their graduation. Today, radiographs created for non-medical purposes are common: natural history museums, for instance, take X-ray photographs of specimens to examine them without damage. A number of artists— Albert C. Koetsier, Steven Meyers, and Nick Veasey, for instance — also document the hidden skeletons of our world. Tasker stands as a pioneer of botanical radiographs; especially emerging from a period when radiography was young and scientists’ understanding of radiation was still developing, his images represent the new intrigue in using technology to examine the structure of matter — not only in the name of science, but in his case, to also find an unexpected beauty in nature.

"ZURICH, June 26 (Reuters) - Swiss software group SoftwareONE has mandated banks for an upcoming stock market flotation, sources told Reuters on Wednesday, paving the way for a potential multi-billion dollar listing this autumn.  Credit Suisse, UBS and JPMorgan have been hired to advise on the planned initial public offering as so-called global coordinators, sources familiar with the matter said. The IPO could take place in October, one of the people said. The firm is expected to be valued at several billion Swiss francs.  Credit Suisse and SoftwareONE declined to comment. UBS and JPMorgan could not immediately be reached for comment.  Since taking over German IT firm Comparex earlier this year, SoftwareONE employs around 5,500 people. The company, headquartered in Stans, Switzerland, helps companies manage an estimated 10 billion euros in software purchases from vendors such as Microsoft, Adobe and IBM. In 2015, KKR acquired a 25 percent stake in the company, the majority of which is still held by the company’s founders.

"Software companies are contributing an outsized share of growth to the U.S. economy — and not just in Silicon Valley. The software industry represented just 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 but 7 percent of GDP growth from 2014 to 2016, according to U.S. government data compiled by Software.org: the BSA Foundation, part of a trade group that represents big companies like Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce. Meanwhile, software jobs increased about 14 percent from 2014 to 2016, outpacing overall U.S. job growth of about 4 percent. One big takeaway: Yes, the software industry is still growing in places like Silicon Valley, where the fastest-growing big tech companies — like Apple, Google and Facebook — have traditionally located their headquarters and dollars. The top states for absolute job growth are California, Texas and New York, as well as Virginia, Massachusetts, Illinois and Florida — all states with big population centers and established tech industries. But other states are also rapidly growing their nascent software industries. The two U.S. states with the largest percentage increases in software employment from 2014 to 2016 were Kansas, up 38 percent, or 6,100 jobs; and Indiana, which grew by 32 percent, or about 8,800 jobs. Idaho and North Carolina had the largest increases in software’s contribution to GDP in that time. Idaho’s software GDP increased 42 percent, or $280 million; while North Carolina’s grew 41 percent, or $3.8 billion, in two years. What’s happening? All industries, not just those centered on technology, are looking for software talent. Greater competition over a limited pool of technology employees is pushing companies to go where the employees are, according to Colin Yasukochi, director of research and analysis at real estate firm CBRE. In its tech-talent report earlier this year, CBRE found that 63 percent of jobs in IT — a term they defined more broadly than just software — were in industries outside of tech. From precision farming in agriculture to driverless technology in automobiles, old industries require new software talent. Companies therefore are often sourcing software employees in university towns with steady supplies of computer science graduates. Secondarily, Yasukochi said, major tech hubs like the Bay Area can be prohibitively expensive as far as cost of living. Companies looking to get more bang for their buck, and employees looking to make their salaries go further, are sometimes choosing software jobs in lower-cost cities. Some recent examples: In May, Salesforce, which has its second-largest presence after San Francisco in Indianapolis, opened a new office tower — the tallest in Indianapolis. The company also promised to add 800 new jobs in Indianapolis within five years. This summer, Indian software company Infosys and Swiss financial institution Credit Suisse upped their presence in the Raleigh-Durham, N.C., area, known as the Research Triangle for its proximity to universities. Take a closer look at GDP and employment growth by state here: For this report, Software.org commissioned the Economist Intelligence Unit to analyze their own data, along with data from Implan, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau. They determined software jobs to include software publishers, computer systems design and related services, data processing, hosting and related services and internet publishing and broadcasting and web services.

"Harvey Weinstein has been fired from the company he co-founded. Matt Lauer is gone from NBC. Mario Batali has stepped away from his restaurants. What was striking about putting together a list of people who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct in recent months was not necessarily the prevalence of the problem — unfortunately, women and gender-nonconforming people have long been aware of the sheer ubiquity of sexual harassment and violence. What was surprising — what felt new about this time in American history — was that of 105 people Vox included on the list, more than 50 have faced legal or professional consequences, from job suspensions to jail time. It’s too soon to tell what the long-term impact of #MeToo will be, but in a number of individual cases, it has produced swift action. And yet perhaps the most powerful man on the list — President Donald Trump — so far has avoided any consequences at all. Trump has been accused of sexual harassment, assault, or other misconduct by more than a dozen women, and has been caught on tape bragging that “when you’re a star,” women let you “grab ’em by the pussy.” Despite all this, he remains the country’s chief executive and commander-in-chief, and his press secretary has brushed aside the allegations against him by saying, “the people of this country, at a decisive election, supported President Trump.” There are many reasons Trump hasn’t faced the same consequences as Weinstein and others, starting with the fact that Republicans in Congress — and voters — chose to support him despite women’s reports that he had harassed or assaulted them. Members of Congress criticized him, and a few even withdrew their endorsements, but House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ultimately stayed behind him, just as they do today. It’s possible that this support could ebb. Trump’s lawyers are fighting a defamation lawsuit by Summer Zervos, who says Trump kissed and touched her without her consent in 2007 — her lawyers have subpoenaed all Trump campaign documents relating to “any woman alleging that Donald J. Trump touched her inappropriately.” If that suit makes it to the discovery phase, the American people could learn a lot more about the allegations against Trump. Meanwhile, several women who say Trump harassed or assaulted them are calling for a congressional investigation into his behavior. They have been joined in their call by a group of Democrats in the House. “The #MeToo movement has arrived and sexual abuse will not be tolerated, whether it’s by a Hollywood producer, the chef of a restaurant, a member of Congress or the president of the United States,” said Rep. Lois Frankel (D-FL) earlier this month. “No man or woman is above the law.” For now, though, the reckoning that began when Bill O’Reilly was forced out at Fox News and accelerated enormously when the revelations about Weinstein broke has left many behind. It has yet to offer much visibility to women of color in low-wage jobs — many of whom, as Vox’s P.R. Lockhart notes, face multiple barriers to reporting harassment. And it has yet to require any accountability of the man who once bragged about his ability to grab women’s genitals, and who today holds power over many aspects of women’s lives. The coming year will almost surely bring more reports of harassment and assault, more names for the list. Whether it brings real consequences for one of the most boldface names remains to be seen.",more-than-50-people-have-faced-consequences-after-sexual-misconduct-allegations-but-not-trump.txt,drew.uq
"Bernie Sanders fell so far behind Hillary Clinton Tuesday night that it's all but impossible for him to catch her, barring some sudden and seismic change in the race. Last week, I wrote a post laying out what would have to happen for Bernie Sanders to pull off an improbable comeback victory. And in Tuesday's elections, he didn't even come close to those targets. The votes are still being counted in some states, and Sanders was leading Missouri at press time. But Democratic proportional delegate allocation rules mean that if a race in a state is close, the identity of the winner barely matters — both candidates will get a comparable amount of delegates. The states that matter the most for the delegate count are, instead, the landslides. Before Tuesday, Clinton had already built up a lead of 215 pledged delegates over Sanders due mainly to her landslide victories across the South. And the landslides tonight all went in Clinton's favor. At press time, she was: So since Illinois and Missouri are close races where the delegates will be split pretty much evenly, Clinton's pledged delegate lead will expand substantially as a result of these blowout wins — from 215 to around 315. And of course, that's not even to mention Clinton's enormous superdelegate lead. Here's how rough the math is for Sanders going forward: To win a majority in pledged delegates, he needs to win 58 percent of those remaining. That might not sound so bad. But because all the Democratic contests allot their delegates proportionally, it's actually punishingly difficult. It means Sanders has to beat Clinton by around 58 percent to 42 percent pretty much constantly. And that's just incredibly implausible given what's happened so far, and especially given what's happened tonight. Even unexpected wins for Sanders in big states like California, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey — already unlikely — wouldn't be enough. Sanders has to win those states by enormous margins. And there are still a great deal of delegates left in states and territories with large nonwhite populations — states with demographics similar to those that have favored Clinton so far. These include Maryland, Arizona, New Mexico, and even Puerto Rico (which Clinton won in a blowout in 2008). Plus, any further Clinton victory just makes the targets Sanders has to hit even more absurd. At this point, the only thing Sanders can really hope for is that some scandal emerges that tanks Clinton's numbers everywhere. Other than that, she's well on track for an easy victory.",heres-the-math-for-bernie-sanders-going-forward-it-doesnt-look-good.txt,drew.uq
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Before North Korea’s condemnation of U.S.-South Korea military drills, even U.S. policy wonks who follow every twist and turn of events on the Korean peninsula probably did not know much about them. That was no accident.  The Pentagon made a point of keeping the annual exercises off the front pages, even as U.S. military leaders including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis saw them as critical to the U.S.-South Korean alliance.  Mattis set an explicit policy of going quiet on North Korea, including on the drills, two months ago, just after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled his willingness to hold an unprecedented meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.   “I do not want to talk about Korea at all,” Mattis told a small group of reporters on March 10 as he flew from Washington,  D.C., to the Gulf state of Oman.   On Tuesday, North Korea threw into question the summit between Trump and Kim scheduled for next month, angrily blaming the drills and calling them “an intentional military provocation,” North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.  The North Korean announcement upended Mattis’ goal of carrying out the drills without intense media coverage. But it also appeared to affirm his concerns about drawing too much attention now to U.S. military activity on the Korean peninsula, which has long vexed Pyongyang.  Pyongyang has viewed the U.S.-South Korean drills as rehearsals for invasion.   In early March, South Korea’s National Security Office head Chung Eui-yong said after meeting with Kim that the North Korean leader understood that “routine” joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States would continue in spite of improving relations.  This was widely seen as a major concession by North Korea as the United States seeks its denuclearization, though Pyongyang never publicly withdrew its long-standing demand for an end to the drills.  Mattis made no secret that he feared that talking about exercises could somehow complicate the work of diplomats,  something that appears now to have happened regardless of the Pentagon’s go-quiet approach.  “What I want you to understand is that right now every word is going to be nuanced and parsed apart across different cultures, at different times of the day, in different contexts,” he told reporters in March when asked about the drills.  He said U.S. officials directly involved in the diplomatic effort should be the ones talking about North Korea.  So, the Pentagon kicked off one of its biggest annual air combat exercises, Max Thunder, with South Korea on May 14 without even issuing a statement.   It was only when North Korea appeared to throw next month’s summit into question because of the drills that the Pentagon started pulling together information for the media about them.  Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California, said, “It snuck up on me.”   Pollack said he only became aware of the Max Thunder drills when the KCNA statement was issued, adding, “They (the Pentagon) have been very low key about everything.”  Max Thunder, one of two exercises being conducted, is an annual air combat drill at Gwangju air base involving more than 1,000 forces from South Korea and the United States.   Although KCNA described the drills as the “largest-ever,” the Pentagon said they were similar in size to previous years.  “During Max Thunder, U.S. and (South Korean) aircrews have the ability to fly missions in realistic scenarios. This type of training is integral to our ability to safeguard the Korean Peninsula together,” a Pentagon spokesman said.  Max Thunder is scheduled to end on May 25 and the other exercise, Foal Eagle, is expected to run until the end of May. The summit between Trump and Kim is scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.  Kim’s latest move could be aimed at testing Trump’s willingness to make concessions ahead of the summit, which is due to be preceded by a visit to Washington next week by South Korean President Moon Jae-in.  Bonnie Glaser of Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank said Kim may be being influenced by Chinese President Xi Jinping after two recent meetings with him. The Chinese leader has advocated a freeze in North Korea’s nuclear program in return for a freeze in U.S.-South Korean drills.  That concession was previously ruled out by U.S. and South Korean officials.  “The fact this issue is back on the table suggests Xi Jinping may have raised it with Kim, and that Kim is carrying Xi’s water,” she said.

"President Donald Trump took another swing at his opponents Thursday morning, claiming that the majority of civil servants suffering under the current government shutdown are mostly Democrats.  “Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?,” Trump tweeted, without providing any proof for his assertion.  But for these federal employees, the shutdown isn’t just a matter of political brinkmanship. The gridlock in Washington over border wall funding is hurting their livelihoods and their ability to pay for basic necessities.  And now they’re taking to social media, using the hashtag #shutdownstories, to air their complaints about the shutdown, letting the public and lawmakers know that not getting paid isn’t easy for working families — especially during the holidays.  A mother worried about paying for her diabetic son’s insulin treatments. Another mother voiced concern about making rent without pay on meager savings.

The shutdown is estimated to affect 800,000 workers, 380,000 of whom are furloughed, at home without pay, according to estimates from the Senate Appropriations Committee. The other 420,000 federal workers are deemed “essential,” and will have to keep working without pay through the shutdown.  Most government employees expect to eventually get back pay when the spending bill is passed and the government reopens. But government contractors aren’t so lucky: they're essentially jobless until then. In the meantime, many of these federal and contracted workers are taking to social media to share their strife, using the hashtag #shutdownstories. The Trump administration isn’t giving workers much hope that the impasse will end anytime soon either. No votes are scheduled in Congress this week, and Trump has shown little appetite for a compromise, vowing to keep the government shuttered for as long as it takes.  And if that doesn't work, he's made it clear he's more than happy to blame Democrats. But the voting public, doesn’t seem to agree with the president, and his approval rating is dipping as the shutdown drags on, according to a new poll.

" David Bazan is playing in people's living rooms again. He does this a lot. He picks up and drives around a few hundred square miles of the US, stopping off in his fans' apartments as he goes, playing delicate acoustic shows to the couple dozen people who sit on the carpets at his feet. You'd be forgiven for thinking that there's a parallel between Bazan's upbringing in the church and his current touring format; it's all very New Testament. But beyond that disciple instinct, the former Pedro the Lion auteur is also uniquely cut out for all this as a performer.   His new single, ""The Ballad of Pedro y Blanco,"" is a clear example. Like the rest of his forthcoming fifth solo album Care, it's entirely synth-driven, all glitches bright arpeggiated sparkles. But Bazan's baritone is steady, so close to the front of the mix that you forget about the backdrop entirely. He could have played the track on an acoustic guitar, an 808, a grand piano, or a set of tuned garbage cans; you'd still be fixed on Bazan's narrative arc and stoic, soft delivery.  Lyrically, Bazan is at his sharpest, telling a two peoples' life stories over five verses: ""Pair off with the one you like the best,"" ""Look out here come two little ones,"" ""in love and the money's alright."" He doesn't shirk from the tragedy at the end, either. It's sweet and succinct with nothing left in without purpose.  We asked Bazan about the track and he responded with this quote from the Coen Brothers' 1987 movie Raising Arizona, starring Nicholas Cage.  Listen to ""The Ballad of Pedro y Blanco"" below.

"The “bump stock” — an obscure accessory that transforms a semi-automatic assault rifle into a rapid-fire machine gun — has been widely available for purchase online and in gun stores across the country for years.  And then it was used in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.  On Tuesday, the devices — commonly sold under the “Slide Fires” brand — were listed online by Walmart and hunting equipment giant Cabela’s at prices ranging from about $90 to $300. But by Wednesday, Slide Fires had vanished from both companies’ websites. Cabela’s and Walmart did not respond to multiple requests for comment from VICE News.  Their disappearance coincides with the news that gunman Stephen Paddock was equipped with 12 bump stocks for the 23 firearms he had on hand when he mowed down revelers at a country music festival in Las Vegas from his 32nd-floor hotel room on Sunday night. At least 58 people were killed and more than 500 injured.  Bump stocks allow shooters to unleash a hail of bullets by harnessing the gun’s recoil to rapidly pull the trigger and mimic automatic fire. The devices made it possible for Paddock to fire approximately 90 rounds every 10 seconds, according to audio analysis of the gunfire.

The devices made it possible for Paddock to fire approximately 90 rounds every 10 seconds, according to audio analysis of the gunfire.  Earlier this week, bump stocks were still being marketed aggressively by online retailers and through ads on Facebook. Like many Americans, I’d never heard of a bump stock until the aftermath of Sunday’s mass shooting, but soon after I started perusing listings for bump stocks, Cabela’s targeted me with an ad for one in my Facebook feed. The particular bump stock that appeared on my feed was the popular “Slide Fire” — the Mercedes Benz of bump stocks — sold at Cabela’s for just $169.99. “Safe, fun and legal,” Cabela’s website said. “Unleash freedom.”  Facebook did not respond to VICE News’ request for comment. There’s no legal reason not to aggressively market bump stocks. In 2012, in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, led an effort to outlaw the devices, but her bill died in the Senate. The Las Vegas massacre has prompted renewed concern among other lawmakers besides Feinstein, who reintroduced the bill.  “I don’t know anybody who goes deer hunting that needs to retrofit a gun to fire hundreds of rounds per minute,” Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, told NBC News. “It’s to slaughter people.” Even some Republicans weighed in, including Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Dean Heller of Nevada.  Just like guns tend to sell well after mass shootings, it’s possible bump stocks are flying off the shelves post-Vegas. Half of the “Slide Fires” for AR-15s (the priciest ones, at that) on Slide Fire Solutions’ website are currently out of stock. On Tuesday, I called around various Cabela’s locations to inquire about their in-store supply of bump stocks. At a Hudson, Massachusetts, location, they didn’t have any devices left in-store, but the shop assistant told me I could purchase one online and I wouldn’t need any ID, because it’s not an actual firearm.  At a Cabela’s location in Henrico, Virginia, they had only one Slide Fire left, priced at $279.99. The assistant there told me that I would need to show proof of age to purchase in-store, but nothing else. At another in Fort Mill, South Carolina, they also had one Slide Fire left, a cheaper model priced at $199.88.  There weren’t many reviews for “Slide Fires” on Cabela’s website, but most of them were positive. “A fun way to waste ammunition,” one customer wrote last month, and gave it four stars. “Loads of FUN,” wrote Mike from West Virginia. “If you enjoy shooting your AR, this makes it a blast. You can empty a 30-round map in seconds and smile like crazy spending $$$$ at the same time.”  “Most fun you can have with your clothes on,” wrote another satisfied customer.  Slide Fire Solutions is based out of Moran, Texas. Their website credits the invention of the bump stock to Jeremiah Cottle, a U.S. Army veteran who served during the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts, as well as in the Middle East during Operation Enduring Freedom. “The honor, commitment, and perseverance that is practiced in our U.S. Military is carried over to the core beliefs and practices of our company,” the company’s website states.

"Jurors are now deciding the fate of a former Texas police officer who was convicted of murder for fatally shooting a black, unarmed teenager last year in suburban Dallas.15-year-old Jordan Edwards was killed when Oliver, a police officer in Balch Springs at the time, fired into a car full of black teenagers as it drove away from a house party.Oliver faces between five and 99 years in prison, according to an Edwards family attorney. DALLAS (AP) — Jurors are now deciding the fate of a former Texas police officer who was convicted of murder for fatally shooting a black, unarmed teenager last year in suburban Dallas. Wednesday marks the second day of the sentencing phase in the trial of Roy Oliver, who was convicted Tuesday for the 2017 slaying of 15-year-old Jordan Edwards. Edwards was killed when Oliver, a police officer in Balch Springs at the time, fired into a car full of black teenagers as it drove away from a house party. In a rare guilty verdict in a police shooting case, the Dallas County jurors were not swayed by Oliver's claim that he feared for his partner's life when he fired into the vehicle. His partner told jurors he didn't fear for his life. Gasps echoed around the courtroom as the verdict was read. Edwards' relatives sobbed and hugged prosecutors, waved their hands in the air and proclaimed ""Thank you, Jesus!"" after the jury left. His father, Odell Edwards, briefly spoke outside the courtroom before heading back in to begin listening to the sentencing phase of the trial. He said he was thankful for the decision of the jury — which featured two black members out of 12 jurors and two alternates — and felt like jumping for joy. ""I just want to say I'm happy, very happy,"" he said, adding that it's ""been a long time"" since he felt that way. Jurors later heard from Edwards' father when he testified during the sentencing phase of the trial. He told them his son always had a smile on his face and dreamed of playing football at Alabama. Oliver faces between five and 99 years in prison, according to an Edwards family attorney. Oliver and his partner were responding to a report of underage drinking at the house party. Police initially said the vehicle backed up toward officers ""in an aggressive manner,"" but later said that bodycam video showed the vehicle was moving forward as officers approached. Oliver was fired just days after the shooting. Experts say it's extremely rare for police officers to be tried and convicted of murder for shootings that occurred while they were on duty. Only six non-federal police officers have now been convicted of murder in such cases — and four of those were overturned — since 2005, according to data compiled by criminologist and Bowling Green State University professor Phil Stinson. Stinson, who tracks such cases nationwide , told The Associated Press on Tuesday that to secure a murder conviction, the facts of a case have to be ""so over the top and bizarre"" that the officer's actions can't be rationally explained. Experts also say that securing a conviction against an officer is often a challenge because jurors are inclined to believe police testimony and criminal culpability in such cases is subjective. Oliver was found not guilty on two lesser charges of aggravated assault stemming from the shooting. Jurors deliberated for two days before reaching the verdicts. The sentencing phase stretched into the evening Tuesday before jurors recessed for the day. ""This was a long fought battle,"" said Daryl Washington, an attorney representing Odell Edwards in a civil lawsuit filed in the death. ""We are just happy ... that Roy Oliver is gonna have to do his time for taking Jordan's life. What he did on that night should have never happened."" Washington said black children and teenagers across the country can now walk around a little safer because officers know they will be held accountable. In closing arguments, defense attorneys told jurors they needed to evaluate the circumstances from Oliver's viewpoint and from what the former officer knew at the time. But prosecutors described Oliver as out of control and looking for a reason to kill. They argued that his firing into the car wasn't reasonable. The shooting came after Oliver and his partner, Tyler Gross, had broken up the party. Both officers were inside the residence when they heard gunfire outside and responded. Authorities later determined the shots were fired near a nursing home in the area. Oliver retrieved his rifle and went toward Gross, who was ordering the car carrying Edwards to stop. Oliver testified that he saw the car back up and stop for a second before moving forward and going toward Gross. Oliver told the jury the car was about to hit his partner. Oliver said he felt he had no other option but to fire. Gross, however, testified that he did not fear for his life and never felt the need to fire his weapon. He also said he didn't feel like the vehicle was trying to hit him. Prosecutors said Oliver fired after the vehicle passed Gross. Investigators also said no guns were found in the teens' vehicle.",extexas-cop-found-guilty-of-murdering-black-teen-faces-99-years.txt,drew.uq
" Twitter wants to fix its long-broken verification process, according to the company’s CEO, Jack Dorsey. The means by which users obtain “a blue checkmark” are nebulous and seemingly biased, and the system’s flaws were exposed after Jason Kessler, organizer of the violent Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was verified this week.  Kessler’s new credential caused many to fault Twitter for tacitly endorsing the ideals he espouses—essentially, white supremacy. The verification process, according to Twitter, is supposed to authenticate a person’s identity. But, instead, it’s created a hierarchy of “Very Important Tweeters,” or “VITs,” as they are referred to internally by staff.   What does it mean when VITs include racists and bigots?  While Twitter’s verification steps are now automated, at one point, users could only snag a blue checkmark by knowing someone within the company. According to a former Twitter employee, who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, the process was once very difficult. (A few years ago, there wasn’t even a form to apply for a verification.)  And while the process was never explicitly preferential, it engendered the belief that “it was a big deal for us to get a famous person verified, as if it validated that Twitter continued to be important,” they said.  Twitter’s own rules say that accounts of public interest may qualify for verification. Users must submit several ID types to receive a badge. That can include a government-issued ID, like a passport, and summary of why you deserve to be verified. Submissions are largely vetted by Twitter Support, which dumps applicants into various buckets: celebrity, journalist, athlete, business, politician, etc.  But some people claim the Twitter verification process hasn’t worked that way for them. Rebecca Watson, a popular science podcaster and founder of Skepchick, who has been prominent enough for years to reasonably be considered an “account of public interest,” claims she submitted multiple forms of ID to verify herself after people created fake accounts impersonating her. Still, at the time, Twitter refused to verify her.  Kessler, meanwhile, describes himself as a “freelance journalist” for far-right publications: “I must be the only working class white advocate [to be verified],” he tweeted.  The Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, VA, convened white supremacist and neo-Nazi demonstrators, and caused the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, when 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. intentionally drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.   While Twitter’s official line has always been that verification isn’t a value judgment by the company, in practice that hasn’t been the case. For example, verified users can sort their mentions to only include tweets from other verified users. While Twitter claims that verification exists only as a means of identification, verified users are widely perceived to be more important or valued than unverified ones.  The former employee told me that the issue of problematic users asking for verification was regularly raised on Falquora, an internal forum where employees can pose questions to management.  “Leadership claimed that verification was working as intended. Every time it became a big issue, [the verification of white supremacist Richard Spencer, for example,] it would come up on Falquora as a thing,” the former Twitter employee said.  The issue of controversial users being verified would “get upvoted, and either Jack [Dorsey], Vijaya [Gadde, Twitter's general counsel], or other leaders would get up on stage and give us a speech about how verification is only about confirming that a person is who they say they are.”  A spokesperson for Twitter emphasized that verification has been a known problem, and directed me to Dorsey’s tweet on the matter.  Despite Dorsey’s claim, however, former Twitter staff insist that one fix was suggested repeatedly.  If tiers of verified users were assigned colored badges—still reserving the blue checkmark for influential people—this would allow regular users to authenticate themselves without the onus, or implications, of being a “VIT.”  “The colored verification badges have been brought up internally SO MANY TIMES. I don't know why that hadn't been implemented yet,” another former Twitter employee, who also spoke to me on the condition of anonymity because of a non disclosure agreement, told me. “Everything there is so process heavy that it takes forever, and too many approvals need to happen before anything ever gets done.”  “I know people that deserve to be verified that definitely had a very hard time getting it, and some never did,” they added.  Twitter leadership allegedly dismissed the colored badge solution, favoring a larger platform revamp. But when management was challenged on  how that revamp would happen or help, exactly, staff were never given a satisfactory answer.   Regarding the existing verification process, some Twitter employees have taken steps toward transparency. Twitter’s GM of consumer product and engineering, Ed Ho, questioned whether the company should even dole out a credential as authoritative as the checkmark.  This week’s incident reiterates how unwilling Twitter is to discuss problems inherent to its platform—until it’s forced to. Less than a week ago, a customer service contractor briefly disabled President Trump’s Twitter account, compelling the company to acknowledge flaws with its admin privileges.   A spokesperson for Twitter declined to comment on how the company plans to improve the verification process. ",twitter-verification-has-always-been-a-mess.txt,drew.uq
"Name-calling, taunting, mocking, and excluding another person could become illegal in Saskatoon if a sweeping anti-bullying bylaw is passed by city council on Monday — a possibility critics say is extremely troubling. The bylaw, which defines bullying as ""unprovoked, repeated and inappropriate comment or conduct"" that could cause ""harm, fear of physical distress,"" would target an extensive list of offenses. It hasn't even passed yet, but concerns are already being raised. ""[The bylaw] has the potential to catch a lot of expression that isn't necessarily harmful or that may be offensive to individuals but actually has a valuable purpose,"" Cara Zwibel of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association told VICE News. ""We think we've done our homework here and we're confident we've come up with a good product."" Name-calling, taunting, mocking, and excluding another person could become illegal in Saskatoon if a sweeping anti-bullying bylaw is passed by city council on Monday — a possibility critics say is extremely troubling.

""We think we've done our homework here and we're confident we've come up with a good product."" Aside from physical acts like kicking, pushing, hair pulling, or pinching, the bylaw would punish anyone over the age of 12 for ""shunning, ostracizing, excluding another person and gossiping and rumour mongering,"" as well as taunting, tormenting, name calling, ridiculing, insulting, mocking and directing slurs towards another person. A first-time offender could be fined up to $300, while subsequent offences could land one with a fine of up to $2,500. But the bylaw does leaves room for the conflict to be resolved through mediation if both parties agree to take part. City solicitor Patricia Warwick told the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix that legal staff were ""careful"" to take issues the right to freedom of expression into account when writing the law. ""We think we've done our homework here and we're confident we've come up with a good product,"" she said. But Zwibel believes the language is too broad and ""potentially vague,"" citing the possibility of the bylaw being used to justify, for example, kicking out members of the public from meetings when they are critical of officials. ""I don't think it's the appropriate role of municipal bylaw to deal with these kinds of issues,"" she said. ""It's imperfect, but we do rely on social customs and one another to check each other."" Related: Rehtaeh Parsons' Death Inspired a Cyberbullying Law in Canada — But Does It Hurt Free Speech? Councillor Ann Iwanchuk, who requested that the bylaw be drafted in the first place, told VICE News that while the law is generally well-drafted, certain elements, like the definition of bullying itself, need clarification. Iwanchuk requested that a bylaw be drafted in February 2014 after being particularly moved by a Saskatoon resident who spoke to city council about her daughter's struggles with bullying. ""Her daughter attempted suicide...and that brought home to me how serious this is,"" she said. ""When this girl awoke from a coma two weeks later and actually was disappointed that she wasn't successful in her suicide, so it wasn't even a wake up call. ""There's going to be wording that'll change, and there will be defense lawyers that will rip this thing apart."" ""If we can curb that behaviour so that they don't bring it into adulthood, into our workforce, I think we're doing a positive thing for our city,"" she said. She is concerned, however, as drafted, the bylaw could entice ""frivolous complaints."" ""What is the trigger to a complaint? Is it that somebody didn't look at you correctly? You need to make sure it's for serious, repeated, and abusive behaviour,"" she continued. Iwanchuk also questioned why the proposed bylaw includes private establishments. ""I don't see how prolonged bullying could take place in a private establishment,"" she said. ""If you're at a nightclub, you could leave. You'd probably have other options."" Retired Saskatoon police Sgt. Brian Trainor told VICE News the bylaw, which doesn't make the offences criminal, could be helpful to police. ""I think a bylaw is necessary because it gives police a soft tool to use in cases of bullying,"" he said, but added that he wonders if the wording of the bylaw could be ""misapplied."" ""When it's talking about what is bullying — taunting and all those things — that gets to be fairly vague."" He adds, however, that the bylaw is a starting point that will most likely change. ""There's going to be wording that'll change, and there will be defense lawyers that will rip this thing apart,"" he said. Two versions of the bylaw, which could come into effect just in time for the new school year in September, are to be considered by city council — one which would apply to school property during school hours, and another one that doesn't. The report notes that school boards have ""expressed that they already have sufficient tools and safeguards in place to address bullying behaviour in schools."" It would be up to the Saskatoon Police Service to figure out how the bylaw would be enforced.

"PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - A year after the deadliest high-school shooting in U.S. history, students from Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School look back with pride on the network they have built to stem the country’s epidemic of gun violence through the ballot box.  Even so, it has been difficult for many to come to terms with the trauma of Feb. 14, 2018, when a former Stoneman student with an assault gun massacred 17 people at the Parkland, Florida campus.  “There’s definitely not a day that goes by where I’m not thinking about it, and I know for a fact that everyone that has to walk through those campus gates is thinking about it,” said junior Caitlynn Tibbetts.  The student campaign in support of gun control, which featured a massive march on Washington and in other cities around the country, resulted in the formation of a sprawling national network called March for Our Lives.  With some 500 chapters, it has linked tens of thousands of student activists in pushing for political candidates who support their goals of new measures to reduce gun violence.  “We have to replace these terrible actors who are comfortable putting our lives at risk for a check from the NRA,” said Matt Deitsch, the group’s chief strategist, referring to the National Rifle Association, which opposes what it considers any retreat on gun rights.  Deitsch, along with Emma Gonzalez, David Hogg, Delaney Tarr and Jaclyn Corin, is among the most prominent Stoneman students who have toured the nation to encourage young people to register and vote for pro-gun control candidates.  By “terrible actors,” Deitsch was referring to political incumbents who oppose the group’s goals, which include a ban on assault weapons. It also backs funding for gun violence research and supports universal background checks, disarming domestic abusers and enacting laws to staunch gun trafficking.   “The fact that gun violence is a top issue for the first time ever is something that should scare the people arrayed against us,” Deitsch, 21, said with evident pride.  Having put together a multimillion-dollar war chest, with the help of A-list celebrities like George Clooney, Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg, the network aims to expand to thousands of high schools and colleges by the end of 2019, giving it even more clout going into the 2020 election.   On Monday, activists were to launch a petition campaign to put an assault weapons ban on Florida’s ballot in the 2020 election. March For Our Lives leader Hogg, among the first Stoneman students to call for greater gun control in the hours after the shooting, was expected to attend the campaign kickoff, along with parents of some of the victims. The petition needs 800,000 signatures.   Success has come at a cost for the student activists. Since last year’s shooting, many have not had enough time to grieve or properly process the tragedy.   In a series of recent Twitter messages, Tarr, a March for Our Lives co-founder, reflected on having to put on a composed “performance” over the past year as a public figure on social media.   “I can’t sit back and let you think that I’m always fine, that I’m always ready to go. That’s not realistic,” she wrote. “I’m a human being and god damn if all of this work and pain isn’t hard.”  The past year has brought more U.S. gun violence, complicating the task of recovery. In a shooting with echoes of Parkland, a gunman at Santa Fe High School in Texas killed 10 and wounded 14 on May 18. Months later, an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh left 11 dead and six injured.   By the end the year, that pair of shootings, combined with hundreds of others, left a total of 387 dead, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  “We carry a heavy weight, and every single day there’s another mass shooting in America, and we see ourselves as vessels amplifying what’s going on this country,” Deitsch said.  For many students, sharing their experiences, both broadly and with those who have gone through something similar, has been therapeutic, however.  Not long after the shooting, a publisher contacted Sarah Lerner, a journalism and English teacher at Stoneman, about publishing a book filled with reflections of that day and its aftermath.   “Parkland Speaks: Survivors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas Share Their Stories” was released late last month and includes 43 accounts of the shooting and what followed, including two pieces by Tibbetts, the junior.  “This book gave us the opportunity to look past politics and look at the heart of it,” Tibbetts said. “And the heart of it is that we’re struggling to move past it, but we’re trying.”  Reporting by Zachary Fagenson; Editing by Frank McGurty and Tom Brown",for-parkland-survivors-a-year-of-political-gains-and-unresolved-pain.txt,drew.uq
"PARIS (Reuters) - American rookie Tony Finau got the first Ryder Cup staged in France under way on Friday as thousands of fans descended on the Le Golf National for the biennial clash of the continents.  The peace of the countryside near to historic Versaille was shattered as fans streamed in to find vantage points around the pristine Albatros course for the eagerly-awaited 42nd edition of one of sport’s most compelling team events.  Looming behind the first tee, the Ryder Cup’s biggest ever grandstand was packed to its near 7,000-capacity long before the players emerged across a footbridge to start their rounds at just past 8 a.m. local time.  Deafening chants of “Europe, Europe” echoed down the first fairway as Justin Rose and Spanish rookie Jon Rahm reached the tee to take on Finau and three-times major winner Brooks Koepka.  Defending champions United States are looking to win on European soil for the first time for 25 years and have resurgent 14-times major winner Tiger Woods to spearhead their challenge.  While the support was overwhelmingly in favor of the hosts, there was plenty of loud backing for the Americans too, with many of their countryman sporting stars and stripes outfits.  The atmosphere was more akin to a soccer match as the day’s fourballs began with a smattering of partisan pantomime boos greeting the announcement of the American team.  The banter was generally good-natured, however.  “It’s fantastic, so much energy so early in the morning,” Josh Hunking from Texas, watching his first Ryder Cup in Europe, said. “I’ve never heard Europeans make so much noise.”  It all proved too much for Finau, whose iron off the tee went way left, just avoiding water — Europe’s fans showing no mercy as they reveled in his understandably nervy start.  Koepka steadied the ship with a straighter drive but the day’s first hole went to Europe with Rose sinking a birdie to thunderous roars from the stacked crowds around the first green.  Finau, U.S. captain Jim Furyk’s final pick, joined the party with a chip-in eagle at the sixth to level match one.  The day’s second match featured Danish newcomer Thorbjorn Olesen playing alongside Rory McIlroy against world number one Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler.  World number 45 Olesen, the lowest ranked of the 24 players taking part, looked dry-mouthed as he addressed his ball on the first tee and sent a nervy drive into water.  Whichever colors they were wearing, the arrival of Woods for his first Ryder Cup shot for six years, was the moment many had arrived so early to witness.  The 42-year-old responded with a drive that landed safely on the first fairway.  Woods, playing with self-styled “Captain America” Patrick Reed, was up against British Open champion Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, one of five rookies in the Europe team.  Following the quartet of morning fourballs, the afternoon will see four foursomes matches, in which team mates play alternate shots using the same ball.  The U.S. need a minimum of 14 points from the weekend’s matches to retain the trophy.  Around a quarter of a million tickets have been sold for the week with around 70,000 expected to follow the action on Friday.  The spectacular 7,234-yard layout offers superb viewing for fans with grassy banks flanking the fairways and most greens set in natural amphitheatres.  There are also 18 huge jumbotrons around the grounds to keep fans up-to-date with all the day’s twists and turns.

"Ordinarily the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is in the business of stopping diseases rather than spreading them. When it comes to mosquitoes, though, the foundation is funding an approach that aims to spread a disease among mosquitoes that would prevent those bugs from spreading Zika and other diseases. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Susan Desmond-Hellmann showed off a kit at Code Conference on Tuesday that looks like a Chinese food take-out box that contains female mosquito eggs that have been infected with a bacteria. When these insects are born, they will produce offspring that is unable to transmit a variety of diseases, including Zika. Part of the reason the foundation is focused on this approach is that Zika itself wasn't on anyone's radar as far as serious disease threats. Past outbreaks caused only flu-like symptoms and not the birth defects and other serious issues that the current Zika outbreak is causing. ""Zika wasn’t on anyone’s list,"" Desmond-Hellman said. By contrast, Ebola was seen as a potential bioterrorism risk so the global health community was at least a ""tiny bit"" prepared for the 2014 outbreak. Even Ebola had in the past been limited to just 2,000 cases. The Gates Foundation has been funding the Australian researchers behind the STD approach for more than eight years, originally to halt the threat of Dengue fever, though the same approach should also help fight the spread of Zika, as well as Chikungunya, another serious mosquito-borne disease.

"Another businessman-turned-politician was elected Tuesday, though with significantly less controversy. Former Microsoft executive Doug Burgum won his bid to become the governor of North Dakota, fueled by a socially moderate, fiscally conservative campaign. Burgum, who sold his Great Plains Software business to Microsoft in 2002 for $1.1 billion, laid out his plans in a January email interview with Recode. “The role of governor is the closest thing to a CEO job in government,” Burgum said. “I have spent my working life attracting capital and talent to North Dakota.” Here’s an edited transcript of that interview. Recode: What made you want to run for governor? Doug Burgum: The private sector, free markets and technology are all huge positive forces that have literally helped change the world. I am grateful to have been able to spend my life as an entrepreneur in the global software industry. The role of governor is the closest thing to a CEO job in government. I have spent my working life attracting capital and talent to North Dakota. I am interested in working where I can have the biggest impact on my home state, and the role of the governor in North Dakota, among other duties, is to be the lead ambassador and cheerleader for attracting human and financial capital to the state. I have no desire to be a politician. I do want to be an elected leader. Are there lessons from your career as an entrepreneur that you feel guide your political philosophy? Yes. Competition drives innovation, lowers cost, speeds delivery and more. Most government services are monopolies, or near monopolies, and therefore have lacked the market forces that produce better solutions. And most government agencies are lagging behind private industry in technology adoption. There are big opportunities to re-invent government service delivery at all levels. Which is hardest, running your own business, working for Steve Ballmer or running for office? Each of these represent unique joys and challenges! I ran Great Plains for 18 years, worked with Steve for six and a half years, and have been running for office for 16 days. The biggest change across all three of these over the last 30 years is the nonstop, 24-hour role that social media plays in building brand, driving opinion and engaging with customers (voters). What do you make of the Republican presidential race? It has been great for TV ratings and for people who own media outlets in Iowa and New Hampshire. It remains to be seen if the process produces a viable national candidate who will be competitive in the fall. Today’s campaigns and candidates are a product of a convoluted, legacy, state-by-state primary process that would possibly not exist if one was tasked to start from scratch to invent a new process for identifying and vetting the very best individuals to serve as president of the United States. How can technology help solve some of the issues facing North Dakota? Every industry in North Dakota (and everywhere else) is facing accelerating change. Moore’s law, super-cheap storage, increasing bandwidth infrastructure and a proliferation of super low-cost, highly accurate automatic data sensors are transforming every process and workflow. There has been a truism in the tech world that “every company needs to become a software company, or be disrupted by one.” I believe this is absolutely true. We have a global oil surplus today because of the rapid advancements in technology. This stands in stark contrast to a multi-decade narrative that we were “running out of oil.” In energy exploration, some of these technologic advances that have contributed to the unforeseen abundance, such as deep horizontal drilling, were pioneered in the Bakken formation in North Dakota. Technology ranging from self-driving tractors with GPS precision, real-time soil analysis (to reduce fertilizer needs) and continued advances in hybrid seed technology are reshaping production agriculture. Health care delivery markets and systems have been completely distorted by government regulation and mandates, making our health care system less productive. These productivity losses will be compounded by demographics: We have more caregivers (doctors and nurses retiring) and more patients aging, so this will put additional pressures on our health care systems. The only way out of this productivity inversion for health care is to streamline operational workflows with automatically generated data. And our North Dakota education system, which needs to serve a significant rural as well as increasing urban population, will need to accelerate its efforts to raise outcomes to ensure students of all ages have the skills they need to be competitive in a global economy. What role is technology playing in your campaign? Our campaign team is like a lean tech startup today. We are into rapid prototyping and continuous improvement and building community. There are so many low-cost amazing tools, solutions and platforms — from social media, to fundraising, to building websites, to CRM, to accounting and more — to help us share our messages. Anything else that you want to make sure people know? I am running as a moderate on social issues and as a fiscal conservative in a state that is socially conservative but has seen government spending rise more rapidly than even our fast-growing economy (fueled by the oil boom and billions of dollars of revenue surpluses at the state level). This race will be decided on the June 14th primary. This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",former-microsoft-executive-doug-burgum-is-north-dakotas-next-governor.txt,drew.uq
"""How can you be a professional basketball player and miss over half your free throws?"" As the ""hack-a"" strategy becomes more widely adopted in the NBA, that question gets asked more and more often. The answer is surprisingly simple: because they can be. The scene is as familiar as it is numbing. An opponent of the Rockets, the Clippers, or the Pistons decides that they'd rather simply send Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, or Andre Drummond, respectively, to the free-throw line than defend straight up. For the next several minutes of game time—and seemingly hours of real time—the action slows to a crawl as the targeted big man takes painful free throw after painful free throw. This practice reached its apotheosis (or, more accurately, its nadir) during the Rockets-Pistons game Wednesday night. After losing Howard to an ankle injury in the first minute of play, Houston sent Drummond to the line 36 times, where he missed 23 free throws, a single-game record. The Rockets even started the second half with little-used reserve K.J. McDaniels, who immediately committed five fouls in nine seconds to force Drummond to the line, and ultimately to the bench. According to ESPN's Kevin Pelton, who has been extensively tracking and discussing the issue, through January 20 there have already been 223 intentional, off-ball fouls this season, compared to 164 in all of the 2014-15 campaign. Without re-entering the intertwined debates about whether this is good strategy (in most circumstances, it's not) and what, if anything, is to be done about the practice (it's complicated, not least because imposing severe penalties for intentional fouling almost certainly means replay reviews, and all of a sudden, there goes the time saved by not fouling), it is important to address the issue that makes this strategy viable in the first place: Just how is it that someone with such an extreme deficit in the fundamental basketball skill of hitting an uncontested, (largely) untimed 15-footer can make it this far? It comes down to specialization, demographics, and how the two interrelate in today's NBA. Modern NBA basketball relies on a division of labor amongst the five players on the court. In other words, there are positions. Though many of these roles have become more elastic during the ""positional revolution"" of the past decade, teams and lineups still need a mix of several discrete skills to be successful. Ball-handling and creation. Rebounding. Outside shotmaking ability, and so on. One of these bundles of skills has come to be known as rim protection, which is based on the premise that layups are the easiest shots in basketball but become much harder if attempted in the vicinity of a very tall (even by NBA standards) man. Certainly, a good rim protector will possess other abilities in addition to great height and/or wingspan—anticipation, vision, lateral and vertical quickness, discipline—but the importance and impact of just being big is, for lack of a better term, huge. Here is where demographics come into play. Extremely tall people are such a small segment of the population that precise estimates are hard to find, but according to this calculator (which is based on Centers for Disease Control data), a 20-year-old male standing 6'10"" or taller is in the 99.9997th percentile of height for men his age. That's about three rim-protector-sized young men for every million. Meanwhile, someone 6'5'' or taller—roughly the minimum height for a NBA wing—is in the 99.5339th percentile. That might not appear to be much of gap, but it's the difference between choosing from hundreds of potential players and hundreds of thousands. Lower the height requirement to 5'10'' and suddenly you're choosing from 45 percent of the population, a pool of tens of millions. While the set of ""potential NBA players"" is far smaller than that, there are still vastly more candidates at guard size than there are for centers. While not a perfect comparison to those demographic breakdowns—both because official league heights are often slightly fictional (as in ""6-foot-13"" Kevin Garnett, who didn't want to be seven feet tall and thus forced to play center) and because people often grow somewhat taller even after age twenty—the height distribution of NBA players is telling. According to NBA.com, 124 of the 447 players who have appeared thus far this season are listed at 6'10'' or taller. By comparison, 212 players are between 6'5'' and 6'10'', leaving just 111 under 6'5''. Those numbers change year to year, but generally speaking the NBA as a whole will give jobs to a higher proportion of 6'10'' players than 6'1'' prospects, in large part because of the importance of skills like rim protection and rebounding, and due to the advantages sheer size gives in accomplishing those tasks. So while a 6'1'' point guard or even a 6'7'' small forward who can't hit free throws is unlikely to clear the many hurdles a player needs to leap to reach the NBA, a taller player is far more likely to get some leeway. A seven-footer needs to be an extreme outlier in terms of explosiveness and coordination to a degree far lower than that of his shorter peers—he's already an outlier by virtue of his size. Smaller players don't tend to be quicker, or better shooters, or more skillful because of their size. Rather, the relatively smaller players in the NBA are those things because they had to be in order to stand out sufficiently. Does this mean many taller players advance up the ladder from high school and AAU to big time college to the NBA without honing their skills and understanding of the game to the same degree as their peers? It certainly does. Through that process, bad habits develop, habits that are hard to undo by the time players reach the NBA level. Rajon Rondo has been little more successful improving as a shooter than have Drummond, Jordan, or Howard. Furthermore, there being so few players of sufficient rim-protecting size and agility allows these players to stay in the league despite whatever skill deficiencies they may have. Perhaps the most surprising part of Hassan Whiteside's rise to prominence over the past year or so is the fact that he was out of the league to begin with—players of his physical stature tend to find a spot somewhere, as demonstrated by the likes of Kendrick Perkins, JaVale McGee, and Ryan Hollins finding spots year after year. Perimeter players seem to improve as shooters as their basketball careers go on. Some of this indeed represents the players' own efforts; some of it is due to the fact that, aside from the top stars—Rondo with his playmaking, Dwyane Wade with his athleticism and shotmaking—players who do not become competent shooters tend to find themselves on the outside looking in (creating an effect known as survivorship bias). That competitive pressure does not apply to the professionally very, very, very tall to quite the same degree. To bring it back to specialization of skills: the rim protection, rebounding, and physical presence provided by those few players who happen to both be enormously tall and prodigiously athletic moves things like free-throw shooting from the ""required"" to the ""preferred but not necessary"" section of the job description. So when it comes to hack-a-big-man, NBA fans have two choices: stop complaining about players missing foul shots, or start complaining about there not being more seven-footers in the world.",free-throw-follies-andre-drummond-doesnt-need-to-get-better-from-the-line.txt,drew.uq

" Most people use the giant online video game platform Steam to buy games and move on, but others build communities. As we've previously reported, Valve, the company that operates Steam, does very little moderating. So the platform is full of hate groups.   As the nonprofit news organization The Center for Investigative Reporting first reported on Friday, it appears Steam is also full of groups that venerate school shooters. Valve is a multi billion-dollar game company with at least 125 million users. Its code of conduct specifically prohibits racism and “threats of violence or harassment, even as a joke.” That fact that some of these groups have been allowed on a platform for years is yet another example of how Valve not only fails to enforce its own policies, but normalizes extremist thinking.   “Plan to shoot up Forest Lake state school,” a user named School Shooter 66 wrote in the Steam group School Shooting Squad group in March 2017. “I plan to bring an M16 , 3 mags, suicide pills and an axe."" The user goes on to detail his plan of attack, and clarifies in all caps that ""THIS IS NOT A JOKE.""  Other user-created Steam groups talk about school shootings, take their names from prominent school shooters, and celebrate mass killers such as Elliot Rodger, who shot six people to death near the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2014. One group, “Future School Shooter Material,” has 106 members and bills itself as “a group dedicated to the bright young minds who are tortured by bullies. Join if you want to be a future school shooter.”  Another group called “School Shoot Gang” used a picture of Columbine shooter Dylan Klebold as its avatar. “Remember Columbine High?” It asked. “That was just a warmup. For Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.” There are groups dedicated to Elliot Rodger, George Zimmerman, and Charles Manson. As of this writing, searching Steam’s groups for “school shooter” returns 248 results. Some of the groups have just a few members, while others have more than a hundred.  Many of the messages are not just violent, but also racist. “Whos in charge of shooting the ni**ers and sp**s?” A user asked in one of the Steam groups. “I thought I was but I’m not sure.”  In a group that called California murderer Elliot Rodger an American hero, one user made a vague threat to repeat Rodger’s massacre. “I am like Elliot Rodger,” the user said. “Don't you worry guys, I will prove it soon!”  We know for a fact that at least one school shooter shared his worldview on Steam before carrying out an actual shooting. William Edward Atchison posted racist ramblings and calls to violence on Steam and other online communities for years before killing two students and himself at Aztec High School in New Mexico on December 7, 2017. A Steam group named after the neo-Nazi Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi organization associated with several recent murders, regularly posted to YouTube and Steam.

"A collaboration between artist Christina Kelly and author Amy Sohn pairs cast concrete objects with true stories about long-ago Gowanus residents. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Sometimes, to make historical objects speak to contemporary viewers, you have to give them actual voices. Artist Christina Kelly and author Amy Sohn did just that with Gowanus Underworld, their collaborative project currently on view at Trestle Projects, which pairs cast concrete sculptures with monologues that narrate true stories about the neighborhood’s historic residents. An old porthole prompts the story of three Manhattan women who, in the summer of 1936, bought an old welding barge for $160 at auction and turned it into their private, floating cottage on the Gowanus Canal. A bent bulkhead nail — nearly a foot long — cues the story of Joseph Zappula, a longshoreman who, in 1950, was on the end of the human chain that pulled little Diana Svet from the Gowanus Bay. “Christina selected these objects to cast from the collection of Proteus Gowanus, and then we dove into the photos from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle archives in the Brooklyn Public Library’s Brooklyn Collection,” Sohn told Hyperallergic.”It was a matter of creating an emotional life for these real-life characters so that people can have a connection to these objects.” As part of curator Melissa Staiger‘s group show Falling In, an array of four concrete sculptures by Kelly is paired with four portable speakers, each playing one of Sohn’s accompanying monologues. Most the stories are narrated by actors and last less than two minutes, just long enough to prompt an imaginative journey in the viewer. They lend the concrete sculptures a quasi-archaeological aura, filling out the details surrounding these fragments of yesteryear’s everyday. Under a tiny cast of a gas valve, a recording tells the story of a single mother who tried to kill herself and her children to get back at their father, who’d run off with another woman. A cast chunk of the historical Coignet Building is paired with the story of Dr. John C. Goodridge, Jr., the artificial stone enthusiast who constructed the building in 1873 to both house the offices of and demonstrate the capabilities of his business, the New York and Long Island Coignet Stone Company. The company filed for bankruptcy the same year the building was completed. “We were interested in the theme of failure, which is an overarching theme related to Gowanus — the failure of industry; the failure of the environment; the failure, until recently, to redevelop the neighborhood,” Sohn said. “We all have this image of what Gowanus is becoming — this idyllic image of family life — so we were also looking for stories about families and failed families.” The final monologue, which has no corresponding sculpture, guides the viewer out of Trestle Projects and onto 6th Street. Cued up on smartphones via a QR code, the story focuses on Detective Bernard Grottano, who, in April 1915, investigated a gruesome murder at the lumber yard at 167 6th Street — an address that, as luck would have it, is still home to a lumber yard (not all Gowanus industry has failed). “You could do a whole series on murders, drownings, and suicides,” said Sohn, who hopes to expand the project with additional stories. “I’m also interested in uncovering the stories of the women who worked here. There’s a long history of women working in Gowanus, especially in the textile mills, and yet it is thought of as a very masculine area.” Or, as a policeman told the three young women in 1936 as they searched for their new barge: “That’s on the Gowanus Canal, and it’s no place for ladies!” Christina Kelly and Amy Sohn’s “Gowanus Underworld” project is part of Falling In at Trestle Projects (400 3rd Avenue, 2nd floor, Gowanus, Brooklyn) through October 22. The gallery will have special hours, 12–6pm, during Gowanus Open Studios (October 15 and 16).",the-history-of-gowanus-cemented-in-sculpture.txt,drew.uq
"Dementia has long been thought of as an inevitable part of aging, but researchers are increasingly learning that’s not quite true. About a third of dementia cases might actually be avoided by living a lifestyle that better protects your brain. Dementia is how we describe symptoms that impact memory and lead to a decline in cognitive performance, often in ways that disrupt daily living. There are different brain disorders that cause dementia, but Alzheimer's is the most common, followed by cerebrovascular disease and Lewy bodies disease. Around the world, some 47 million people are currently living with dementia — including more than 5 million Americans. The burden of Alzheimer’s alone on families and the health system is difficult to overstate: It’s the most expensive disease in America, costing up to $215 billion per year (more than double that of cancer or heart disease), and it can take a terrible toll on patient’s loved ones. The number of people with dementia is also expected to triple worldwide by 2050 as populations age. But there’s some good news: You might be able to modify some of your risk of developing dementia. A major Lancet report, by 24 leading dementia researchers from around the world, zeroed in on nine of the best-known lifestyle factors that contribute to the illness and account for more than a third of dementia cases. The takeaway: Addressing these factors might be able to cut our dementia risk by up to 35 percent. Another bit of good news is that the prevalence rate of dementia has declined in some countries, including in the US. And researchers think it may in part be due to increases in levels of education, which seems to protect people from getting dementia. For a disease many of us fear, the message is hopeful: Dementia is not necessarily an inevitability. Dementia symptoms typically show up in old age, but the brain changes that cause it are thought to develop years earlier. These are things that might help stave off those changes: 1) Check your hearing and get a hearing aid if you need one It’s not yet clear why, but there’s a strong correlation between even mild hearing loss and an increased risk in cognitive decline and dementia (and the dementia risk goes up with more severe hearing loss). Hearing may be important to dementia because of what study lead author, University College London professor Gill Livingston, called “the use it or lose it model.” “We get a lot of intellectual stimulation through hearing,” she told Vox after the study was published in 2017. So when a person can’t hear as well their brain may begin to shrink. Researchers think hearing aids could help reduce that risk, but they need better evidence to know that for sure. 2) Keep learning Less education is also associated with an increased risk of dementia because of something researchers call “cognitive reserve,” or a person’s resistance to assaults on the brain. “Low educational level is thought to result in vulnerability to cognitive decline because it results in less cognitive reserve,” they wrote, “which enables people to maintain function despite brain pathology.” 3) Stop smoking Smoking is bad for the brain because it degrades cardiovascular health (and interferes the body’s ability to deliver oxygen to the brain). Tobacco also contains neurotoxins, which damage the brain. 4) Seek out treatment for depression It’s still not entirely clear whether depression contributes to dementia, or whether dementia puts people at an increased risk of depression. But the researchers concluded that it’s “biologically plausible” depression boosts a person’s dementia risk because it “affects stress hormones, neuronal growth factors, and hippocampal [brain] volume.” Making sure people are treated for depression could mitigate a person’s dementia risk, and the researchers said antidepressants might also help, but called for better evidence to understand the effects of the medications. 5) Exercise Exercise is believed to protect the brain by reducing cortisol levels in the body, cutting vascular risk, and increasing the growth of nerve cells that are related to memory. So people who are inactive are at a greater risk of dementia because they don’t get the extra protection exercise confers. 6) Manage high blood pressure Stress on the circulatory system increases the risk of neurodegeneration, which also contributes to dementia. 7) Be social Like depression, it’s unclear whether social isolation is a symptom or cause of dementia. “However, evidence is growing that social isolation is a risk factor for dementia and it increases the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and depression,” the researchers wrote. The theory is that social isolation is similar to not being able to hear, Livingston explained. “You need a cognitively enriched environment to keep the brain in good health, and if don’t see people or can’t hear them, you get less of that stimulation.” 8) Maintain a healthy body weight Researchers believe obesity causes brain damage because it’s linked with reduced blood flow to the brain and it increases oxidative stress, which is also bad for the brain. 9) Keep your blood sugar in check People with diabetes are more likely to have dementia. One reason why: Having diabetes means you can no longer control your blood sugars. And having more sugar in your blood stream means more sugar in your organs, including the brain. So just as diabetes can damage other organs in the body, it also damages the brain. This list of nine contributors is only the beginning. The scientific community is already learning about other potential contributors to dementia, such as exposure to pollution and lack of sleep. “So we don’t think this [list of nine things] is everything but this is what we have evidence on now,” said Livingston in 2017. There are other caveats to note about this research. Some of the factors — such as hearing loss, or social isolation — are again associated with dementia, but whether they cause dementia isn’t yet clear, and researchers are working to better understand dementia’s causes. What’s more, not all cases of dementia are preventable; about 7 percent are linked with genetics and can’t be modified with lifestyle changes. And, the researchers wrote, “age, the greatest risk factor for dementia overall, is unmodifiable.” Even so, Livingston added, people should think about finding ways to cut their dementia risk, and policymakers should think about creating environments that promote health. For example, some communities aren’t walkable, or lack strong tobacco control policies. Making exercise more accessible, and helping people quit their smoking habit, could reduce the dementia burden. Considering what a costly and devastating problem dementia is, we can’t wait for better evidence.

It’s a horrific act of violence in an already-horrific week of violence following the Orlando shooting in the US. In the wake of the killing, this tweet clearly struck a nerve and was widely shared: Female MPs get daily death and rape threats: ""It's just online, why can't you ignore it?"". Female MP is murdered: ""An unexpected tragedy."" We don’t yet know the assassin’s motivation. Suspect Thomas Mair has been linked to a US-based Neo-Nazi group, the National Alliance. There are unconfirmed reports that Mair shouted ""Britain first!"" before attacking Cox, a reference to the hotly debated ""Brexit"" referendum on whether Great Britain should leave the European Union, which Cox vocally opposed. Cox was also a strong supporter of helping Syrian refugees. Officials are also investigating National Action, a white supremacist group that has campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union. ""It’s an attack on democracy, what happened yesterday; it’s the well of hatred that killed her,"" said Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. But whatever the killer’s specific motivations, Beth Murray’s tweet resonated with people who take online harassment of women seriously and are frustrated that many, including law enforcement agencies, often do not. Her words also speak to the powerful role that male hatred and misogyny plays in varying degrees for women in power. Several women in Parliament have been subjected to vicious misogynistic attacks on Twitter — including one MP, Jess Phillips, who received 600 rape threats in one night. The incidents have fueled criticism that Twitter isn’t doing enough to protect users from harassment. Cox herself had experienced such harassment, and her security was reportedly increased after a three-month campaign of harassing messages against her. One man was cautioned by police for sending her ""malicious communications of a sexual nature,"" but he wasn’t the suspect. Police also said that there was no known link between the harassing messages and the attack on Cox. While police determine the killer’s possible political motivations for the attack, we shouldn’t ignore the likely role of pure hatred in it, and the role that hateful misogyny too often plays in attacks like these. In 2011, US Congress member Gabrielle Giffords was shot and nearly killed by Jared Loughner, who reportedly had sexist views and believed that women shouldn’t be in power. Giffords was Loughner’s local representative, as Cox was Mair’s. Orlando shooter Omar Mateen, Planned Parenthood shooter Robert Lewis Dear, and numerous other men who committed lethal high-profile mass shootings were also reported to have private histories of brutal domestic violence and sexual assault. And as I reported for Vox this week, most ""mass shootings"" as typically defined by news outlets are actually domestic violence attacks, often against women or children. Every high-profile shooting has unique circumstances, and every killer has different motivations. But extreme misogyny is such a common thread in so many of them that we can no longer ignore its role in public violence. Correction: The original headline of this article referred to Cox as a British ""PM."" She was a member of Parliament, or MP — not PM, which stands for Prime Minister.

"As Hurricane Irma draws closer to the Florida coast after devastating the Caribbean, where it affected more than 1.2 million people and led to at least 20 deaths, residents of the Southeastern coast of the US are frantically trying to prepare for the destruction it might bring, from leveling homes to knocking out power to thousands upon thousands of people and businesses.  But with panicked efforts underway to save families, pets, and homes, some emergency responders in Florida and Louisiana are also committed to saving an asset that some fear is particularly susceptible to damage during the storm: expensive wines.  According to Newsweek, collectors and wine suppliers are rushing to move valuable stockpiles of valuable wines out of the path of Irma, which was downgraded from Category 5 to Category 4 as of Friday afternoon and is expected to make landfall tomorrow morning. The gravest concerns for collectors are flooding, which could destroy labels and degrade corks, and power outages that could shut off fridges. Changes in temperature can even cause bottles of wine to explode under some circumstances.  Adam Gungle, the chief executive officer of a wine transportation service called Xpeditr, which specializes in protecting wine investments during natural disasters, told Reuters, ""The wrath of a hurricane can ruin delicate pieces of liquid history... Hurricanes Andrew, Katrina and Sandy ruined tens of millions of dollars worth of fine wine. A lot of these bottles survived World War I, World War II."" Some of the collections being relocated are worth millions of dollars and include bottles that are more than a century old. Gungle also noted that some of the bottles are being aged by collectors to be donated to charity.  Xpeditr founded its Emergency Response Team after Superstorm Sandy destroyed millions of dollars worth of wine when it struck the East Coast in 2012.  English billionaire and Virgin founder Richard Branson revealed today that when he found that his 74-acre private island were in the path of Hurricane Irma, he survived by holing up in his wine cellar.  As he braced for Irma's arrival last night, Branson wrote on his blog on Virgin's website, ""Knowing our wonderful team as I do, I suspect there will be little wine left in the cellar when we all emerge."" Thankfully, he, his team, and the wine all made it through the storm.  ""We took shelter from the strongest hurricane ever inside the concrete cellar on Necker and very, very fortunately it held firm,"" he wrote in a follow-up blog post today. ""I have never seen anything like this hurricane. Necker and the whole area have been completely and utterly devastated... For those who are still in the path of Hurricane Irma, and Hurricane Jose to come, I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to put safety first and prepare as strongly as possible. Having seen first-hand the power of this storm, please ensure you stay inside, ideally in organized shelters or other solid concrete structures with water, supplies and emergency contact plans.""

"Raúl Ortega Ayala’s new exhibition at Proyectos Monclova includes a buffet based on a historical image of the restaurant atop the World Trade Center and a model of the Tower of Babel sculpted out of lard. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads MEXICO CITY — A scene from a grotesque flesh ritual is acted out in the main gallery of Raúl Ortega Ayala’s Food for Thought, a show revealing humanity’s incredible capacity to consume. It might ruin your appetite, but beneath the drama there are layers of subtlety and nuance in the video works and installation. The works, which span the top floor and the basement galleries of Proyectos Monclova, are part of the same series but comprise distinct projects dealing with consumption and food in two different ways. The artist connects consumption habits to ceremony, debauchery, and the decline of society. The video works on the top floor deal directly with food culture through a style of artistic-anthropological study, which marks the culmination of three years of research for Ortega Ayala. Three videos are accompanied by two small paintings tucked into the corners of the installation, leaving the main gallery mostly dark. Amid the darkness, three warm floodlights illuminate “Babel Fat Tower” (2010), a contemporary nod to Pieter Bruegel’s masterpiece. An actual tower of lard, the sculpture emits a subtle stench as the lights heat the glistening pile, which is intended to melt down over the course of the exhibition. The metaphor isn’t exactly subtle, but the stinking pile loans a meaty materiality to the cold video installation nearby. Alongside the large video projections, the small paintings don’t call attention to themselves. They are inspired by foie gras and stuffed pig, except that the overfed animals in these images are represented by human hands making shadow puppets, and they allude to another motif that echoes throughout the show — the performance of food. They also reveal the painter in Ortega Ayala. This painterliness reemerges in the videos, where the artist frames human figures in compositions reminiscent of a Rembrandt, emphasizing the fleshy body and packing the frame with a tangle of limbs and saturated colors. The pair of projections in the main gallery space make up the two-channel video work, “Tomatina-Tim” (2016). On one screen, Ortega Ayala films the annual La Tomatina festival in Buñol, Spain from above, its many participants dissolving into a sweaty mass of bodies covered in blood-red tomato juice and flesh. Despite the festive atmosphere and the zealous roar of a thousand drunken bros, the drama turns dark and sad when the tomatoes run out and the crowd disperses, leaving people strewn about, sitting or lying in the wet trash. The noise of the crowd dies down and a woman’s scream is identifiable amid the din. Then we see her on the screen, surrounded by a throng of shirtless men trying to rip her shirt off — apparently part of the tradition of the festival, as seen during the peak of the tomato mashing madness, but the assault and the woman’s desperation are palpable. On the opposite screen, a hotdog-eating champion and professional gurgitator named Tim sits down casually to a pile of a few dozen hotdogs at the famous restaurant Nathan’s, smashing them into his mouth two at a time and soaking the buns in water so that they slide down his throat more easily. This training routine of excess epitomizes something pathological in our culture of consumption, where satiation is never possible. Part of Ortega Ayala’s intention is to underline the ridiculous pointlessness of these ceremonies, whose only purposes are indulging gluttony and celebrating excess — how appropriately and sickeningly poignant. The festival of debauchery and wasted food in Spain bears the markings of an ancient pagan fertility ritual, but there is no higher meaning here, as Kim Córdova points out in the exhibition text. Are there traditions of excess, or does gluttony itself fill the void left by a lack of tradition? Another video on view, “Untitled (Cheese Rolling)” (2017), documents the flailing, tumbling, tangled participants of the now world-famous festival in Gloucestershire, England, where participants race down a steep hill in pursuit of a tumbling wheel of cheese, resulting in a variety of totally avoidable blunt trauma injuries. The slow motion video shows the martyrdom of the townspeople willing to sacrifice themselves in the name of decontextualized tradition. There is a deeper metaphor about ‘biting the hand that feeds you’ suggested by Ortega Ayala’s work downstairs. In the main gallery, a very strange scene awaits. A feast has been prepared, based on a vintage image of a buffet at the Windows on the World restaurant, which served clients atop the North Tower of the original World Trade Center. This powerful evocation of September 11 gave way to a shared meal during the exhibition opening, the spread surrounded by vitrines of images and newspaper clippings documenting the cleanup of the collapsed skyscrapers. The meal’s moldy leftovers remain on display in the gallery. In the vitrines, Ortega Ayala traces the material of the felled towers to companies in India and China, which purchased the twisted metal as scrap steel in order to make new buildings, housewares, or maybe even weapons. The common practice of recycling scrap steel is suddenly complicated by tragedy and the enormous, all-encompassing cycle of destruction and construction. In Food for Thought, Ortega Ayala attempts to connect modern practices of gluttony with their possible origins in tradition or ritual, but the result is an expression of some primitive desire of the flesh to get drunk and dirty. The image of the mythical tower turned into an homage to lard alludes to our corrupted best intentions to reach toward the heavens. The artist portrays modernity, through the recycling of an unimaginably destructive tragedy, as the evolution of our attempts to clean up the mess from the trial and error of building (and rebuilding) civilization.

"The announcement follows a similar decision by Tate, announced yesterday, that the institution will no longer accept funds from the Sacklers, owners of Purdue Pharma. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Today, Hyperallergic confirmed that the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York “does not plan to accept any gifts” from the Sackler family, the controversial owners of Purdue Pharma. The family and drug manufacturer have been accused of misleading medical professionals on the gravity of the drug OxyContin, and are currently the targets of lawsuits on behalf of the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Yesterday, Tate’s board of trustees announced that the museum will no longer accept funds from the Sackler family. In the New York Times’s coverage of the unprecedented decision, the Guggenheim was cited saying that “no contributions from the Sackler family have been received since 2015 and no additional gifts are planned.” Today, the Guggenheim confirmed with Hyperallergic: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum received a total of $7 million in gifts from members of the Mortimer D. Sackler family initiated in 1995 and paid out through 2006 to establish and support the Sackler Center for Arts Education, which serves approximately 300,000 youth, adults, and families each year. An additional $2 million was received between 1999 and 2015 to support the museum. No contributions from the Sackler family have been received since 2015. No additional gifts are planned, and the Guggenheim does not plan to accept any gifts. Earlier this week, London’s National Portrait Gallery decided to not accept a donation of £1 million (~$1.3 million) from the Sackler Trust. This morning, The Art Newspaper revealed that last year a South London Gallery returned a £125,000 (~$165,000) donation from the Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation, gifted to build an education center in 2014. These institutional changes follow widespread protests from drug policy advocates including photographer Nan Goldin, best known for her series The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.  In 2017, Goldin founded PAIN Sackler, a drug advocacy organization that demands “all museums, universities, and educational institutions worldwide remove Sackler signage and publicly refuse future funding from the Sacklers.” In February, PAIN Sackler held a die-in at the Guggenheim and then marched to the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a large protest of the Sacklers’s major influence as art philanthropists. In January 2019, Daniel H. Weiss, president and CEO of the Metropolitan Museum said the institution “is currently engaging in a further review of our detailed gift acceptance policies, and we will have more to report in due course.” Today, the museum informed Hyperallergic that the institution does not yet have an updated statement regarding this review. Editors note 3/25/19: The Metropolitan Museum of Art has sent Hyperallergic an updated statement on behalf of Daniel Weiss, stating: The issue of Sackler funding reflects a complexity that is common in this area. The Sacklers began supporting The Met over 50 years ago – decades before the invention of opioids and the public health crisis that has later ensued. The contemporary Sackler family is large and there are varying relationships among these branches with Purdue Pharma (some have had no relationship with the company for decades). Incidentally, the Museum has not received gifts from the Sackler family over the past two years. All of this demonstrates the need for the Museum’s leadership team to be highly deliberative. We will continue our review of the Museum’s gift acceptance policies, will adjust wherever necessary, and will be transparent in our process and conclusions.",guggenheim-museum-does-not-plan-to-accept-any-gifts-from-the-sackler-family.txt,drew.uq
"This article originally appeared on VICE Sports UK. It's that time of the week again, when we feast upon a veritable banquet of goals. We have fasted for hours on end in preparation, and we're now ready to gorge ourselves on the most exquisite delicacies that the last few days have to offer. When it comes to excellent finishing, we are vile gluttons, happy to stuff our bellies full of goals until we are groaning and swollen, acutely nauseous with the indulgence of it all. We want goals filling our stomachs, goals dancing across our taste buds, goals running out of the corner of our mouths and down our quivering, multiple chins. Here are the tastiest goals from the past week, then. Gobble them down, like the sickening gourmands you are. Hanlon's goals come at 0:05, 1:15 and 2:25 In all our time writing this column, we have never featured a team from the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division. That's because, generally speaking, football at that level is absolute shite. Once in a while, however, even a Scottish non-league side can produce a moment of sheer brilliance. In this case, there have been three in one game, all coming from a lad named Tam Hanlon. Playing for Glaswegian side FC Pollok in their Sectional League Cup match against Neilston, Hanlon managed to score a sublime hat-trick from the right-back position. First, he fired in a sweet free kick with his left foot. Then, he thumped a long-range howitzer into the top corner. While that was probably the pick of the bunch, he went on to complete his three-goal haul with another free kick, this time tucking home with his right. To repeat: FC Pollok play in the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division. This was a fucking miracle, quite frankly. Now, we know what you're going to say here. You're going to say that the assist for this goal wasn't deliberate, and that the whole thing was a comedy of errors precipitated by a capricious breeze. In the absence of definitive proof, however, we're going to give Thamesmead Town the benefit of the doubt. That being the case, we maintain that this is one of the greatest build-ups to a goal we've ever seen. With Thamesmead taking on Guernsey in the preliminary rounds of the FA Cup, Scott Kinch completely fucked up a shot played a sublime, curving ball into the box. We have never seen a pass get caught up in a gust of wind defy the laws of physics in quite such a miraculous fashion, having been mishit so badly hit with such finesse that it bent back in on itself and landed right in the middle of the box. From there, Thamesmead's Jack Mahoney managed an excellent improvised finish, using complete dumb luck magnificent skill to bundle home lob the keeper from close range. This was not a goal, this was art. In the late nineteenth century, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were a group of mystics and occultists. They studied all things paranormal, and tried to explain phenomena which conventional wisdom could not explain. Even they would have struggled to get their heads around this goal from Shaun Williams, because it's absolutely twatting magical. Devoted to the study of this magnificent goal, we now inaugurate the Hermetic Order of the Golden Shaun.",never-mind-the-polloks-vice-sports-goals-of-the-week.txt,drew.uq
"Welcome to the public markets, Snapchat. Stock for Snap, the company behind Snapchat, fell more than 12 percent Monday, just its third full day of trading. Snap stock finished the day at $23.77 per share, below the $24 opening price it garnered on IPO day last week. The dip appears to be tied to a number of poor analyst ratings, including five “sell” ratings, which is an unusually high number. The biggest concern around Snapchat appears to be tied to user growth. Snap has 158 million daily users but added just five million new users in Q4, a hefty decline from earlier in the year. Of course, Snap is far from doomed just three days into trading — the stock is simply settling after a crazy IPO rush. On IPO day last Thursday, the stock finished the day up 44 percent.

"This post is part of Mischiefs of Faction, an independent political science blog featuring reflections on the party system. A New York Times profile of a cat-loving Nazi and his wife has awoken the anger of the internet. It’s not that this is difficult to do, and the danger of responding to problematic viral articles is that it’s easy to pick apart what’s wrong with such pieces, and often much harder to assess the context in which the idea came about in the first place. There’s been some effort at this in the Twitter conversation, especially with a focus on the lack of racial diversity in newsrooms. Aspects of the news business certainly have something to do with misfires like fluff profiles of violent racists — at the very least, they create an environment where this kind of thing is possible. But the news media doesn’t exist in a vacuum. How to deal with the presence of terrible and destructive ideas in a modern and open society is an ongoing question, and it’s an especially pressing one right now. The place to start with this dilemma is how we think about free speech and the marketplace of ideas — necessities for a free society that pose a real dilemma when it comes to dealing with anti-democratic ideas. People often learn to understand the broad scope of free speech in the US through examples like Larry Flynt, the notorious editor of Hustler magazine, or Nazis marching through Skokie, Illinois, defended in court by the American Civil Liberties Union. These cases, especially when paired with everyone’s favorite decontextualized Voltaire quote, suggest that freedom of speech is primarily about offense and tolerance. But when we think of it primarily in terms of unpopular groups — Nazis, atheists, communists — and in terms of the offense it might cause people, we remove speech, expression, and the associated freedoms protected by the First Amendment from their historical context. Freedom of expression is not just about pushing the boundaries of social acceptability. It is about the ability to challenge power — most literally, to criticize the government without fear of legal consequences. Obviously, ideas about free expression — including the right to hold and express hideous views — have evolved a great deal. These ideas were developed in a world in which political speech was costly. In the United States, we now practice them in a world in which political speech is cheap. This state of affairs makes it easy to obscure the power dynamics involved in some forms of offensive or challenging speech. Our highly limited discourse on the topic means that Nazis and white supremacists are put in the same category with sacrilegious art exhibits and provocateurs like Flynt. Using this framework limits how we can think about what to do with ideas like white supremacy and white nationalism. Thinking about these ideas as merely offensive and marginal ignores a simple and uncomfortable truth. One of the reasons we draw bright boundaries around racist thinking is not because it’s odious and beyond the pale, but because it’s odious and has proven over again to be incredibly potent in the right circumstances. In the US, a history of overt discrimination is still built into many of our institutions. People who fought actual Nazis in Europe are still alive. While Americans mostly use social sanctioning and norms, some societies have responded to these kinds of threats by enacting legal bans on certain types of speech. (Like many Americans, I would oppose legal measures. But I support your right to favor them.) The offending Times profile comes out of a few related developments. The marginalization of violent racism may have become a victim of its own success; as with other surprising political developments of the past few years, it tends to be treated as fundamentally unserious, an approach whose lack of viability is immediately obvious. This makes extremists like the ones profiled in the Times piece seem like curiosities, like people who have weird hobbies. Such thinking no longer makes sense. We now know that the belief in such natural boundaries is a delusion. At the same time, American society seems to be experiencing a moment in which there is a serious debate about who does and does not have power. An entire genre of books and articles about the white working class chronicles its powerlessness in a culture that (at least superficially) prizes education and diversity. The election of the first black president unsettled centuries of racial hierarchy. In other words, there’s a potent and omnipresent cultural narrative of — for lack of a less blunt phrase — white victimhood. When we take complaints about “PC culture” or “identity politics” at face value, we open up space for grievances about “white interests,” whether we want to or not. For years, fringe groups have embraced these victimhood ideas, and now those ideas are part of the mainstream discourse — despite the many documented disadvantages experienced by women and racial minorities. At the intersection of novelty and victimhood, we find stories of Nazis going to Panera, their ideas largely stripped of history and context. Much has been said about the “normalization” of such ideas — that by portraying Nazis as average, even sympathetic, people, journalists run the risk of helping to integrate violent ideologies into the mainstream. The thing is that violent, racist ideologies have spent lots of time in the mainstream. They’ve proven very destructive. The imperative of the moment is not just to debate about how to keep them at the margins, but to remember out loud why they belong there. The danger, then, in an everyday portrait of the white supremacist next door isn’t in the normalization but in the populist ideology that’s buried deep in the narrative. Depictions of ordinary, small, powerless American life have proven an immensely useful political tool at times. These depictions have provided a packaging for executive power, a way to delegitimize war protests, and, of course, a justification for racism. Reducing a white supremacist to the features of his harmless life obscures the horror his ideas can unleash.",depicting-nazis-as-ordinary-gives-them-power.txt,drew.uq

The Radical Eye: Modernist Photography from the Sir Elton John Collection will include over 150 works by artists including Man Ray, André Kertész, Berenice Abbott, and Alexandr Rodchenko. Police are investigating gunshot damage inflicted on the exterior of the Schwules Museum*, an institution in Berlin dedicated to LGBT culture and history. French police seized a painting attributed to Lucas Cranach the Elder from the Caumont Centre d’Art in Aix-en-Provence after doubts were raised regarding its authenticity. According to the Financial Times, as many as 240 staff members at Qatar Museums were laid off as part of a series of budget cuts implemented by the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Christie’s will sell two early paintings by Tony O’Malley, which, when turned over and placed side by side, reveal an unfinished nude by Francis Bacon. The two artists were neighbors in St. Ives in the late 1950s. O’Malley cut the board that Bacon had used in half in order to produce “Currach, Clare Island” and “Evening Landscape Tehidy Hospital.” The paintings are estimated to fetch between £20,000–30,000 (~$) at Christie’s Modern British and Irish Art sale on March 17. Cambridge University will consider repatriating a sculpture of a bronze cockerel after the Jesus College student union voted to return the work to Nigeria. “Okukor” was one of almost 1,000 bronzes plundered by British troops during the 1897 Benin Expedition. According to Mikhail Piotrovsky, the director of the State Hermitage Museum, the British Museum purposely avoided shipping its recent loan of one of the Parthenon sculptures through Europe. “Greece believe that it belongs to them and they could have attempted to seize it at some airport en route,” Piotrovsky told The Art Newspaper. The Walker Art Center will no longer host its wildly popular Internet Cat Video Festival. The museum will donate memorabilia from the festival’s four iterations to the Minnesota Historical Society. A Brief Flowering, an exhibition of works by Welsh artist John Cyrlas Williams (1902–65), will open at the Oriel Plas Glyn-y-Weddw on March 20. In 2004, over 150 of Williams’ works were discovered in the attic of his family home in Porthcawl. Art historian Peter Lord told the BBC that the trove of artworks narrowly avoided destruction. “It turns out that the auctioneers had been clearing the house prior to sale, and that they were about to throw the whole lot on a bonfire in the back garden,” Lord told the BBC. Aegean Airlines will sponsor Documenta 14, which is being co-hosted by Kassel and Athens, and operate flights between the two host cities.

The Freeman family sold its controlling interest in the auction house Freeman’s, which will be transferred to three of the company’s senior managers — Hanna Dougher, Alasdair Nichol, and Paul Roberts. Retired BBC Radio 4 writer Tim Sayer bequeathed his art collection to the Hepworth Wakefield. Sayer’s collection includes works by Alexander Calder, David Hockney, Bridget Riley, and Gerhard Richter.

"If you haven’t read Sarah Kliff and Dylan Scott’s rundown of the various Democratic plans for expanding health care, most of which build on either Medicare or Medicaid, you should. I’ll wait. The policy questions here are profound, but a lesson of past health care reform efforts is that the policy is shaped by the politics. Three political questions, in particular, will shape both the design and the viability of whatever Democrats come up with. Those three questions are: This doesn’t get mentioned much, but it’s perhaps the most important question Democrats will face. The central lesson of both Obamacare and the efforts to repeal it is that getting 60 votes for health care reform is almost impossible. In Obamacare’s case, the filibuster meant Democrats needed to win every single one of their 60 members, which meant every single Senate Democrat held a veto on the bill. Absent the filibuster, the Affordable Care Act could’ve been substantially more generous, and substantially more ambitious. Sen. Joe Lieberman, for instance, vowed to kill the bill unless both the public option and a proposal to open Medicare to 55-year-olds were axed. If Democrats could’ve passed the bill with 51 votes, they could’ve told Lieberman to take a hike. “The big challenge that we faced was the filibuster,” Barack Obama said in 2018. “And it’s a weird thing because it’s not something that the average American spends a lot of time thinking about.” In the GOP repeal effort’s case, it meant that the plans had to run through the narrow budget reconciliation process, a loophole meant to speed budget fixes past the filibuster, but that requires every single provision to directly change spending or taxes. As a result, the GOP’s plans were poorly constructed and often didn’t go nearly as far as Republicans wanted. President Donald Trump isn’t exactly a master of parliamentary procedure, but he quickly realized that the filibuster was the key obstacle. “The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes,” he tweeted. “Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!” A bare majority in the Senate will be hard even if Democrats pull a good hand in 2020. But there’s no path to a 60-vote Democratic supermajority. And while it’s possible to imagine a Medicare-for-more bill making it through budget reconciliation, if Democrats want to do something as complex as reconstructing the American health care system, they’re going to need to be able to write legislation in a simple, straightforward way. That means that Democrats either need to get rid of the filibuster, which they can do with 51 votes, or they need to repeatedly overrule parliamentary challenges to their reconciliation bill, which is pretty much the same thing. Either strategy will be a tough sell: Senate Democrats have rediscovered their affection for the filibuster in the Trump era; even Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says he regrets weakening the rule in 2013. The upside of replacing private insurance with a single-payer system, as both Bernie Sanders’s and the House Progressives’ plans do, is that the system becomes a lot simpler and a lot cheaper, as the government can use its monopsony buying power to force down prices. The downside is most people like the insurance they have, and being told that their insurance will be canceled and replaced with a government plan could unleash a backlash that annihilates the entire plan. Remember the fiasco around President Obama’s “if you like your health insurance, you can keep it”? That was more than roughly 3 million plan cancellations, and most of the plans were cut because of how sparse their coverage was. A true single-payer system, one that replaced the existing system, would mean canceling more than 150 million insurance plans, including many high-quality employer-based plans that people love. In that respect, the more ambitious Medicare-for-all proposals go quite a bit further than the current Medicare program, where about a third of enrollees are actually on private insurance. Vox’s Scott gets at the political dangers here in his piece on the difficulties the employer-based health system poses for reformers: When Vox conducted focus groups on single-payer, led by opinion researcher Michael Perry, one recurring concern we heard was from people who mostly like the insurance they have and were worried about losing it under Medicare-for-all. “I wouldn’t like that,” Richard M., a federal official who gets his insurance through his work, said when told he would have to give up his insurance. “I like having an option. And I mean at this stage, I’m working full time, I should have an option.” The polling bears out this sentiment: 83 percent of people with employer-sponsored insurance said in March 2016 that they thought their health insurance was excellent or good, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. It’s hard to imagine a Democratic White House convincing vulnerable House and Senate members to reap that whirlwind. But if they don’t do it, it’s harder — though not impossible — to get to both true universality and deep cost savings. From the beginning, the Obama administration insisted the Affordable Care Act pay for itself with tax increases and Medicare cuts. This was partly principle — the White House’s concerns about long-term debt ran deep, and Peter Orszag, the budget director, was one of the law’s key architects — and partly politics: Budget neutrality was a condition of support for many of the conservative Democrats the legislation needed to win over in Congress. That decision limited the bill’s generosity and opened up devastating lines of attack that Republicans used, cynically but effectively, to portray themselves as defenders of Medicare in 2010. A lot of liberals look back on this as Obamacare’s original sin — and after watching Republicans pass tax cuts that, once again, added trillions to the national debt, they feel like suckers for dutifully balancing Obamacare’s books. The big question Democrats face next time is less how to pay for their health care plans than whether to pay for them. If they decide to fully pay for their plans, then their plans will have to be a lot less generous and there’ll be a lot more losers from the necessary tax hikes and spending cuts. As of now, the early signs are that Democrats want to hold to their old standards: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said Democrats will abide by the PAYGO rule, which requires both spending cuts and tax increases to be paid for, in the House. I wrote on Friday about how the continued Republican assault on Obamacare has ensured health care remains a central issue for Democrats, and how the nature of the legal assault on Obamacare has pushed Democrats toward Medicare-for-all as an answer. But there’s a reason that, prior to Obama, president after president failed to pass health care reform. To overhaul something as important to people’s lives as the health care system, you need the trust of the public; the votes in Congress; and, if you’re paying for the plan, a whole lot of money. It’s easy to look back on the places Obamacare fell short and imagine how the law could have been more ambitious or more generous, but the compromises written into the Affordable Care Act were written for a reason: The politics of health care reform are hellish, and the modal outcome is failure. Right now, Democrats are in the minority, and so their policy proposals can exist in a pure state. But when they get power, the policy choices they actually make will depend on the political framework they choose. As such, while “Would you get rid of the filibuster?” and “Will you keep PAYGO?” may not sound like health policy questions, they very much are. Indeed, they may be the most important health policy questions.",medicareforall-will-be-shaped-by-these-3-questions.txt,drew.uq
"The Democratic nomination is now Hillary Clinton's to lose. Bernie Sanders still has time to mount an improbable comeback. But, barring any political earthquakes, Clinton's sizable delegate lead and broad coalition make it difficult to imagine how Sanders can pull off an upset, according to close trackers of the race. ""Clinton has been the huge favorite this whole time and continues to be,"" said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""I don't see how Sanders catches up to her."" On Super Tuesday, Clinton surged ahead of Sanders by the metric that matters most: delegates. She racked up 505 delegates in winning seven of 11 states, compared with the 334 delegates Sanders took in winning four states, according to an analysis by Richard Berg-Andersson, a researcher who tracks Democratic delegate math at the Green Papers. (Some districts remained too close to call as of Wednesday morning.) ""Clinton had the night she needed to have,"" Berg-Andersson said. ""She's now well on her way to winning the nomination."" <!--

 // --> Clinton now leads Sanders by around 200 pledged delegates — in large part because of her big wins across many Southern states on Tuesday. It's tough to see how Sanders closes that gap, even if he runs more or less evenly with her the rest of the race. That's in part because the Democratic Party awards delegates proportionally, meaning candidates need to win the popular vote by big margins to make up a delegate deficit. Beyond the delegate math, Super Tuesday provided several other reasons to doubt that Sanders could seriously threaten Clinton for the nomination. Perhaps the biggest reason is that Clinton has continued to clobber Sanders among African-American voters, and not just in the Deep South. She won a massive 93 percent of the black vote in Alabama, for instance, but also won black voters in Oklahoma, Virginia, Texas, and Tennessee by huge margins. There had been some speculation that Sanders had closed the gap with Hispanic voters in Nevada. But as FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten notes, Clinton won Hispanic voters by around 42 points in Texas — suggesting Florida and New Mexico will also be favorable terrain for the former secretary of state. Then there was also evidence that Sanders's appeal is limited even among white voters. Sanders lost Massachusetts, even though white people made up 86 percent of the electorate; he also lost the white vote in Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, and Virginia, according to NBC News's exit polls. The problem for Sanders isn't just that Clinton swept the Southern states. It's also that she's likely run well ahead of him in primaries with big Democratic establishments that loom large on the calendar. ""I think Massachusetts was the most telling win of the night,"" said Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow and director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution. ""In a place that's in Bernie Sanders's backyard and known for its liberalism, she still won."" Clinton's strength in Massachusetts, which she won narrowly, probably reflects her strength in states with strong Democratic institutions. And that suggests she'll have a huge advantage when the contest reaches delegate-rich states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New York. ""Those are areas with large African-American populations and an established Democratic Party organization that will be very Hillary-friendly,"" Berg-Andersson said. ""Sanders is not going to get delegate boosts from those states."" By contrast, the kinds of states where Sanders has done well don't tend to have that many delegates. A big piece of Sanders's coalition has been downscale white voters, who helped him win Oklahoma by 10 points on Tuesday. But while there are many states that fit this demographic makeup, most of them just aren't very big and don't have that many delegates. (Added up, the Sanders-friendly states like Kansas, Nebraska, Idaho, Wyoming, and Oregon have around the same number of delegates as Clinton-friendly Illinois.) None of this is to say that Sanders is certainly done. Sanders's campaign argued on Wednesday that Sanders has a viable path to the nomination that runs through industrial Midwestern states battered by the recession, according to the Washington Post. That strategy would make the March 8 primary in Michigan, which has 147 delegates, a crucial battleground for Sanders. ""We still think we have a winning hand in this game, and we’re going to continue to play it,"" said Tad Devine, a Sanders aide, according to the Washington Post. But with Clinton leading by double digits in several recent national polls, Sanders will have to change something — and do it fast — to alter the fundamentals of the race. ""[Clinton] has a substantial lead, a substantial delegate lead, and a great deal of momentum,"" Kamarck said. ""I suspect she's going to win. But it's not impossible for him to come back.""",bernie-sanderss-path-to-the-nomination-is-getting-very-narrow.txt,drew.uq
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The 18 largest banks operating in the United States took the first step toward doling out capital on dividends, share buybacks and other investments on Friday, after clearing the first stage of their yearly health checks with the U.S. Federal Reserve that assess their ability to weather a major economic downturn.  The central bank said lenders, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp, would face losses of $410 billion under its most severe recession scenario ever, but levels of high-quality capital would still be well above regulatory minimums.  “The nation’s largest banks are significantly stronger than before the crisis and would be well-positioned to support the economy even after a severe shock,” Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles said in a statement.  The Fed said hypothetical losses were broadly comparable to results from prior years, with the most significant loan losses seen in credit cards, followed by commercial and industrial loans.  Friday’s results, the first of the two-part annual “stress test,” showed the country’s biggest lenders could meet minimum Fed standards based on information they submitted to the regulator.  But banks could still stumble next Thursday, when the Fed announces whether it will permit banks to dish out dividends and buy back shares. That second test is more rigorous, assessing whether it is safe for banks to implement their capital plans. It also reviews operational controls and risk management.   All eyes are on Deutsche Bank, which is bracing for potentially its fourth flunking in five years amid ongoing turmoil in its U.S. operations, Reuters reported on Thursday. Last year, the Fed failed the bank, citing “material weaknesses” in its data capabilities and capital planning.   The Fed created the stress tests during the 2007-2009 financial crisis to ensure banks are strong enough to continue lending through a severe economic downturn.  This year’s tests are more streamlined following a Fed review of the process, which has long been hated by the industry. Roughly half as many banks were tested this year compared to 2018 after the Fed earlier this year moved several smaller firms onto a two-year testing cycle.  The 18 banks tested this year hold roughly 70 percent of all U.S. bank assets, according to the Fed.  In addition, most banks can no longer fail on “qualitative” grounds. Previously, banks that had sufficient capital could still be flunked if the Fed identified risk management and operational problems.  In March, the Fed said it was dropping this qualitative objection for domestic U.S. banks. Only the U.S. subsidiaries of five foreign lenders — Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG, UBS Group AG, Barclays Plc and TD Bank — must clear that hurdle this year.  Since the first test in 2009, banks have seen losses shrink, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The largest banks have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $680 billion in top-tier capital, the Fed said.  This year’s recession scenario included a jump to 10 percent unemployment, as well as elevated stress in corporate loan markets and falling real estate prices. However, the Fed also this year gave banks more information about the testing models, after years of industry gripes that the process is too opaque.

"Since the Federal Aviation Administration opened its drone registry at the end of last year, sales of small unmanned aircraft have skyrocketed. In December 2015, sales grew five and a half times from the previous year, according to NPD Group’s Retail Tracking Service, and in March the FAA released predictions that drone sales would reach 2.5 million annually by the end of 2016. One of the most anticipated drones this year, the foldable Mavic Pro from industry leader DJI, was in such high demand the China-based company has been struggling to get its drones out the door by its expected shipping dates. DJI chalked the setback up to a problem with one of the parts in the manufacturing process; the Mavic has been shipping preorders, albeit slower than anticipated. Now, if you want a Mavic Pro you can order one, but according to the company website, you’re unlikely to get it until mid-January, so not in time for holiday gift giving. DJI did manage to get one to Recode, though. The Mavic is branded as a kind of personal drone that’s good for beginners. It’s small enough to fit in a backpack (it folds into the size of a water bottle) and can actually follow you (or a dog or your friend) around thanks to its onboard artifical intellegence. We flew the Mavic Pro at the SF Drone School on Treasure Island in the middle of the San Francisco Bay.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Benchmark U.S. Treasury debt yields fell to their lowest since late 2017 on Monday and a gauge of world stocks dropped for a second straight session on persistent concerns over global economic growth.  The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell below 2.4 percent for the first time since December 2017. Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond yield slid back into negative territory.   MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.46 percent, after it posted on Friday its biggest one-day drop in about three months. Wall Street’s main indexes ended little changed during a choppy session after falling sharply on Friday.  Investors were still digesting weak U.S. factory data last week that prompted an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which is widely seen as an indicator of an economic recession.  “The big story is bond yields,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.   “You are at a point now where a drop in yields isn’t being perceived as being a good thing for stocks... The thinking is,  yields are dropping because the economy is weakening and that’s not a good thing for stocks,” Delwiche said.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.51 points, or 0.06 percent, to 25,516.83, the S&P 500 lost 2.35 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,798.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.13 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,637.54.  Apple shares fell 1.2 percent, weighing on indexes,  as the company unveiled a streaming video service.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.45 percent, its fourth straight drop.  In one economic bright spot, a survey showed German business morale improved unexpectedly in March after six consecutive drops.  Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 12/32 in price to yield 2.414 percent, from 2.455 percent late on Friday. The yield fell as low as 2.377 percent.  On Friday, the spread between yields on three-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes fell below zero for the first time since 2007. Such an inversion is a warning sign about the economy.  Investors were evaluating last week’s dovish pivot by the U.S. Federal Reserve, in which the central bank stunned investors by abandoning projections for any interest rate hikes this year.   The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.12 percent, with the euro down 0.01 percent to $1.1311.  U.S. crude settled down 0.4 percent at $58.82 a barrel, while Brent settled at $67.21, up 0.3 percent  on the day.  Gold prices rose to a more than three-week high, helped by a weaker dollar and as worries over global economic growth pushed investors into safe-haven assets.  Spot gold added 0.7 percent to $1,322.21 an ounce.

"It hasn’t even been a year since the world’s technology elite paused to observe the 50th anniversary of Moore’s Law, and the long knives are already out in force to deny it a 51st. Next month the global semiconductor industry will release its latest biennial assessment of the technological road ahead for making computer chips. As reported by the journal Nature, for the first time, the look ahead will be crafted without the key assumption of the “law,” central in all previous reports: That chipmaking technology will improve sufficiently that companies at the forefront of the business will be able to shrink the size of transistors every two years or so at a more-or-less predictable pace. The new forecast, called the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, is an evolution of what has since 1998 been called the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. For the first time, its outlook will be based less on the view that applications will inevitably follow improvements in raw computing speed and power, but instead that chip advances will be developed with applications in mind: Smartphones, wearable devices and machines running in data centers and so on. Moore’s Law will no longer be considered central to the roadmap. Moore’s Law isn’t really a law of science, but rather an informal observation made about the apparent progress of what was in 1965 a very young chip industry. That year Gordon Moore — who later co-founded Intel — wrote up his thoughts in a paper for the April 1965 edition of Electronics Magazine. He proved remarkably prescient, suggesting that by 1975 a single chip could contain a then-unimaginable 75,000 transistors. The transistor counts of today’s mainstream chips number in the billions. Practically every form of computing and electronics has derived a direct benefit from the unremitting efforts of semiconductor engineers who have repeatedly scaled seemingly impassable barriers in the electrical and materials sciences. The advances have had a monumental long-term effect on society’s ability to process information and to make it faster and easier to access: Every new generation of chip is smaller than and at least as powerful a computing engine as the one that came before it, but less expensive to make. Until now, practically every time doubting wags, including myself, have argued that the time had come for Moore and his law to ride off into the sunset, the engineers in bunny suits have figured out new ways to maintain control of the electrons flowing on a chip. This time is different. As I argued in an essay for Re/code last year, the chip industry is running up against some truly fundamental limits that are causing a lot of people who know a lot more about this than I do to conclude that the time has come to reconsider how we think about improvements in computing. It comes down to this: You can only shrink a chip so much before the physics fails. The most advanced chip currently turned out by Intel is built on a 14-nanometer process technology. A nanometer is a billionth a meter, and the period at the end of this sentence, were it printed on paper, would be about one million nanometers. At 14 nanometers, the individual parts that make up that chip are smaller than a typical virus particle and similar in size to the outer cell wall of an individual germ. It has gotten so expensive and complicated to manufacture at this scale that only four companies are considered to be on today’s leading edge, down from 18 a decade ago: Intel, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. and GlobalFoundries. The next logical steps in the semiconductor roadmap take us to 10 nanometers, which, depending on whom you ask, may appear in commercial chips this year. Beyond that lies seven nanometers — due about 2018 or 2019. Intel can see ahead about that far. TSMC says it will reach seven nanometers sometime next year and is now working to get to five. Generally speaking it’s at the five-nanometer juncture — due maybe in 2021, give or take — that the outlook has tended to get incomprehensibly fuzzy. At that size, elements on the chip would be about twice the size of a strand of DNA. Smaller than that, the design features on a chip become no bigger than 10 individual atoms. At that scale, electrons start to behave unreliably: The laws of classical physics give way to the infamously uncertain rules of the quantum scale. Remember Heisenberg (and I don’t mean the one from “Breaking Bad”)? This is his territory. You might be able to make chips at that size, but there’s no guarantee they’d work. So what’s it all mean? Potentially a much more complex view of the progress of chip technology as we head into the future. As Daniel Reed, a computer scientist at the University of Iowa who was quoted in the Nature essay, says, today’s Boeing 787 doesn’t fly much faster than a Boeing 707 did in the 1970s, but a lot of other innovation has come in aircraft since then, including improved fuel efficiency, lighter airframes and electronic navigation systems. The road ahead will diverge from one into many with different destinations and different milestones along the way. Some indeed may lead nowhere, but others will lead into unexpected territory that we haven’t foreseen. I don’t know about you, but to me that seems kind of cool.

"Off and on growing up, I attempted to keep ""kosher for Passover"" — something my purely secular Jewish family didn't do. In a neighborhood where my claims to being Jewish were inherently suspect because I didn't attend a synagogue anyone recognized or go to youth group conventions and summer camps, it was something Jewish that I could actually do on my own. Or so I thought. All I knew of Passover was what I picked up from the Seder dinner we'd go to on one of the first nights of the eight-day holiday, and in attempting to deepen my observance I simply tried to logic my way out from there. Matzah is part of Passover because, in the Passover story, the Hebrew slaves fleeing Egypt didn't have time to let bread rise; so keeping kosher for Passover meant no leavened bread (or baked goods generally), I figured. I did not know the half of it. As I gradually figured out, somehow, over the course of several abashed rounds of Googling over several years, the actual rules for keeping kosher for Passover aren't about leavening (yeast). They restrict any use of the ""five grains"" — wheat, spelt (whatever spelt is), barley, oats and rye — that start to ""rise"" (i.e., ferment) on their own when put in contact with water. The chemistry, and logic, are beside the point. For Ashkenazi Jews — the Jews of Eastern Europe, the heritage of my father and that of many American Jews — the rules have historically gone further. Ashkenazi Jews have traditionally had to avoid corn, rice, peas, beans, peanuts, soybeans, chickpeas — all categorized under the catchall term of kitniyot. But the rules of kitniyot are falling out of fashion. In 2015, the Conservative Movement — the institution regulating the second-most-observant of Judaism's three main branches — issued a ruling to conservative Jews saying they could eat kitniyot during Passover if they wanted to. This Passover, many of them will — not to mention less-observant Ashkenazi Jews who didn't need a group of conservative rabbis to tell them not to follow rules that didn't make sense to them. I'm not exactly in the habit of listening to the Conservative Movement's rabbis myself. My Jewish practice is eclectic. Keeping kosher for Passover — no grains, and yes, no kitniyot either — is the most Jewish thing I do. Judaism is a religion of commandments. There are, famously, 613 commandments in the Torah alone (at least as counted by one of the authors of the Talmud, one of the major books of Jewish law). How Pope Francis brought me back to the Catholic Church In Hebrew, these are the mitzvot — the plural of mitzvah, which is one of those Hebrew words that's crossed into English via Yiddish. In English-via-Yiddish, a mitzvah sounds like a favor: ""It would be a mitzvah if you did the dishes after Seder."" That's because Yiddish is an irony-heavy language and American Jews are masters of the guilt trip. A mitzvah is really a commandment, just like tzedakah — often translated as ""charity"" — is really an obligation to give. My father, an atheist who taught Torah to third-graders in Sunday school, was in the habit of explaining the commandments within the context of the civilization where they'd been developed: the Fertile Crescent of thousands of years ago. Kosher dietary restrictions — the year-round kind, not the Passover kind — forbid the eating of shellfish? Think about it — shellfish can often make you sick in hot climates, especially at certain times of the year, and it was probably safer to avoid them. Judaism forbids graven images? Think about it — the earliest Jews lived among polytheistic tribes with idols for everything; worshiping only one god, a god too powerful to have a face, was certainly one way to set themselves apart. Later, as an anthropology student in college, I'd learn that this sort of thinking was called structural functionalism — the determination to see a culture as an organism, evolving in response to its environment to keep its members alive and its community cohesive — and that there were other ways to make meaning out of society. But it worked as far as it went. The problem is that some rules simply cannot be logicked. You cannot logic your way into the rules of kitniyot. Judaism is also a religion of jurisprudence. Often, that's a fancy word for arguing — one of the stories in the Haggadah, the script for the Passover Seder, ends with the so-called ""punchline"" of four rabbis being interrupted in a heated discussion by their students telling them the sun has risen and it's time for breakfast. (The real punchline is that subsequent Jewish scholars have tried to explain away the unfunniness of this joke by dissecting its symbolism in the margins of the Haggadah.) Remember, though, that the default state of Jews is diaspora: the dispersion of Jewish peoples throughout the world, and the term used for any Jew living outside of Israel (which described every Jew until the modern Israeli state was created in the late 1940s, and describes most of us today). Diaspora gave rise to the Askhenazi tradition of Eastern Europe and Russia, and the Sephardi tradition of the Mediterranean — distinctions of culture that nonetheless gave rise to certain differences of interpretation. In diaspora, jurisprudence is a crucial tool: a way for rabbis to try to make sense of new experiences and edge cases that the five books of Torah didn't cover or anticipate. Kitniyot is one of these diasporic improvisations. It's a catchall term for other foods that are prohibited during Passover according to Ashkenazi custom. This includes grains that hadn't been native to the Jews of Egypt or their descendants, like corn and rice (though quinoa, a more recent discovery, may or may not count), and any products derived from those. It also includes legumes — beans, peas, soy, peanuts, chickpeas — and the products made from those as well. (The inappropriateness of eating either peanut butter or hummus on matzah is one of the classic gripes of Passover, and is almost a reason to eat matzah the rest of the year — but not quite.) There are, in theory, reasons for this. Maybe the rabbis worried that forbidden grains would be mixed into sacks of peas or corn without anyone noticing. Maybe they were confused by the fact that beans swell when water is added to them, even though they're not fermenting. But fundamentally, trying to justify kitniyot is a fool's errand. It makes sense only as a diaspora kludge. As far as I can tell, there are four basic responses a Jew can have to an arbitrary rule. We can abide by it unquestioningly, for the simple reason that if it was good enough for our ancestors it is good enough for us. (You might be familiar with the song ""Tradition"" from the musical Fiddler on the Roof, but you might have forgotten that this too is ironic — ""Why do we do these things?"" narrator Tevye asks the audience. ""Nobody knows."") We can try to carve out exception upon exception to rule upon rule, using the law against itself. (Faced with the difficulty that multi-story apartment buildings posed to the rules against operating machines on the Sabbath, the rabbis and the engineers devised a solution: Pressing an elevator button was forbidden, but riding in an elevator programmed to stop on every floor would work.) We can kvetch about it. (Moses hears a voice from the heavens: ""Thou shalt not boil the kid in its mother's milk."" ""Aha,"" says Moses, ""you mean we can't mix milk and meat during meals!"" The voice repeats: ""Thou shalt not boil the kid in its mother's milk."" ""Aha,"" says Moses, ""we have to use separate dishes for meat and milk and wait six hours between the two!"" Etc. Finally, the voice sighs thunderously: ""Fine. Have it your way..."") Or we can simply ignore it. Among Conservative Jews (and those of us less observant still), the question is simply how many of the rules we ignore. It can be hard to grasp that the distinctions among various sects of Judaism (not to mention the wide and growing variety of Jewish practices outside established synagogues) aren't about theology but about observance: how many, and which, rules are followed. The technical term for this is orthopraxy — correct actions, as opposed to orthodoxy (correct thoughts). It's a key distinction between Judaism (and Islam, for that matter) and Christianity. Everything you need to know about Passover I grew up in Cincinnati, the home of Reform Judaism — the most relaxed of the three main branches, theologically speaking. If that seems like a welcoming place for a family who identified as Jewish (well, ish — my mother's Episcopalian) but was wholly secular, though, it wasn't quite. Our synagogue was too secular even for the Reform rabbis. I couldn't join the youth groups my classmates participated in; I didn't know things they considered preschooler-level Judaism. (I didn't know the first line of the most basic Jewish prayer until I was in middle school.) My Judaism was seen as, at best, suspect, and at worst wholly illegitimate. It wasn't until I got to college that I met a critical mass of people who identified as ""culturally Jewish,"" and felt free to do so myself without having to prove my bona fides. And it wasn't until after I graduated that I realized I didn't have to keep the ""culturally"" qualifier in front of it — that I had the power to practice Judaism actively without feeling like a fraud for not having attended the right synagogue or learned the right prayers. I owe my Judaism, as I practice it today, to a pair of dear friends I met in college. One was my roommate after graduation and lit the candles with me over Hanukkah; the other took me to High Holidays services and helped me follow along with the Hebrew. Between them, I got an adult crash course in much of what I didn't learn at secularist Sunday school. They teased me, lectured me, and always respected my choices and ideas. I love them dearly. I'm not naming them in this essay because I don't want to offend them if I've mischaracterized them in the following anecdote, but the way I remember it is too good to fact-check: I remember the two of them at a party, side by side, a Jewish two-headed monster. At the end of the day, they explained, one of them probably didn't believe in God. The other one probably did. But of all the differences in their Jewish practice, that was, they agreed, among the least important ones — because the point of their Judaism wasn't what they believed but what they did. To orthodox Jews, this is monstrous: a sickness of modernity. They can't abide the idea of Jews going through the motions to serve a deity in whom they may not believe; to them, this is precisely how Judaism gets reduced from a religion to a culture. And to many Jews who grew up being told to follow at least some of the commandments without any way of reconciling those actions with their beliefs — Jews like my father and the parents of the kids he taught at Sunday school, Jews like many of my peers — it's pointless. They find no meaning in the rituals themselves, and ""because your ancestors did it"" doesn't carry much more weight than ""because I said so."" To them, this is the religion they abandon, even if they acknowledge at least some of Jewish culture — the food, the kvetching, the Yiddish — as their own. But few people are introspective enough to know the precise origins of every trait they've inherited from their parents or been raised with in their homes. People can't always judge what, in their upbringing, was Jewish and what was not. When people slough off orthopraxy as meaningless ritual, they're putting practices and customs in a mental attic, in a box labeled ""Judaism"" — and leaving it at that. They're cutting off an alternative mode of inquiry: thinking about what they have inherited because of Judaism. The education, deliberation, and questioning inherent in the tradition of Jewish arguing and jurisprudence — these are unquestionably Jewish values. So is the commitment to social justice inherent in the obligation of tzedakah. No one would argue that these values are unique to Judaism. But their expression within Judaism is a big part of why they're so important in so many Jewish homes — and to many people who grow up in those homes. I love Pope Francis as much as the next nice Jewish girl. But I get frustrated when people who identify as cultural or secular Jews praise Pope Francis's every ambiguous, possibly-poorly-translated offhand comment to the heavens. I get frustrated when progressives with roots in Judaism spend more time litigating whether attention to poverty is a ""Christian value"" as important as preserving the 20th-century family than they do considering whether they really want progressive ""Christian values,"" or something else. I get frustrated when people label the parts of religion they find ill-fitting or antiquated as ""religion,"" and the parts of religion they're comfortable with — the economic moralizing or commitment to family — as ""values."" I get frustrated when people think of Judaism only as what's in the mental attic, rather than what's in their hearts. Look, I can't blame the Conservative Movement rabbis. I can't blame my peers who started eating kitniyot years ago, or who stop observing Passover entirely after the Seder ends. I certainly cannot throw stones here; again, I'm far more Jewish during Passover than I am during any other time of year. The reasons for getting rid of the kitniyot ban are weak. But there is no good reason to keep it. Judaism isn't ancestor-worship: It cannot be justified simply as an act of following in the footsteps of ghosts. And the fearful rush to protect Ashkenazi culture, fixating on the mortal wound it was dealt by the Nazis, runs the risk of treating it as a culture already dead and just finishing the job. But I can't help it: I worry about making Passover too easy. Maybe it's just that ""kvetching about it"" is my preferred way of responding to this particular set of illogical rules: I've managed to learn how to follow them, how hard can it be? What I suspect, though, is that I'm worried about maintaining the upside of orthopraxy: the way an action forces your attention to a thought, or a value. As a child, Passover didn't feel like freedom. It felt difficult, and self-flagellating. Freedom — I was a child — was the freedom to do whatever I liked. The Seder, of course, anticipates this. There's a point in the Passover legend where the escaped slaves, wandering in the desert, start kvetching about the food: They miss the ""fish and cucumbers"" they were fed in Egypt. The story kind of straw-mans the Hebrew slaves, but it's also a joke for present-day Jews: Slavery sucked, but it's nothing compared to eating nothing but matzah. Now I get it, though. The point of matzah isn't that eating it makes you feel free. It's asceticism and privation. It's virtue-feeling and forced humility. It's a pain in the ass; it's also a profoundly spiritual experience. I’ve spent 30 years counseling priests who fall in love. Here’s what I learned. In the context of the Seder, the attention to current injustice can be hippieish and overwhelming (not to mention hunger-dulled). But while there are only traditionally Seders for two nights, Passover lasts eight whole days. As long as you're keeping kosher for Passover — and inconvenienced enough to notice it — it's impossible to have a meal without being reminded that Passover is still going on. There are worse things than a thrice-daily reminder to be glad for freedom, and to meditate on where people still haven't been freed. People do this sort of thing all the time! We get the concept that physical actions can promote particular mental states when it's called yoga or breathing exercises. We appreciate the small reminder to be moral when it's a Fitbit or a policy ""nudge."" It is hardly as if, in an age of ethical sourcing and carbon impact, there is something alien about connecting food choices to morality. This sounds like trivializing Judaism, the faith of my ancestors, a culture that has sustained my people for thousands of years. I'd argue that even if it were trivializing, it wouldn't be any worse than simply foregoing the practice entirely and dooming it to die. But it isn't trivialization. It's orthopraxy. Judaism roots its values in obligations. You must give tzedakah. You must honor the Sabbath as a day of rest and study. You must be present in the temple on the High Holidays to seek forgiveness for the misdoings of the past year. You must, for eight days, eat matzah — ""the bread of affliction"" that is also the bread of freedom. And sure, you can put peanut butter on it. You can spend eight days eating quinoa and rice. As for me, I'd need a better reason to abandon the stricter rules about kitniyot than that following them is hard. Dara Lind is a Vox staff writer.

"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Wednesday it sacked an army commander and rebuked other senior officers after a North Korean fishing boat piloted by defectors went undetected in South Korean waters for more than two days last month.  The incident has raised concerns about potential lapses in South Korea’s security during fragile talks to end a technical state of war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War.  The small wooden boat spent more than two days in waters south of the Northern Limit Line, which separates areas controlled by the two Koreas, before docking at the port of Samcheok.  The ship’s arrival on June 15 was spotted by closed-circuit television cameras, but authorities failed to identify the vessel as North Korean, said Choi Byung-hwan, vice minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination.  The four fishermen waited, expecting to face South Korean security forces who never came. One man approached a South Korean resident and asked to use a telephone, Choi said, and police were alerted.   The commander of the South Korean Army’s 8th Corps, which oversees the area in eastern South Korea where the boat docked, was removed from his command, the defense ministry said.     The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff received a warning, and two other senior military commanders were referred to a disciplinary committee, the ministry said.  “Our analysis found that there was a failure in our security operation,” Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo told reporters in the capital Seoul.  “This failure was a grave error that cannot be acceptable in any case,” he added.  Two of the fishermen said they wanted to stay in South Korea, officials said, and the other two asked to go home.  At least 546 North Koreans defected to South Korea in the first six months of this year, up from 487 in the same period last year, South Korea’s unification ministry said on Tuesday, according to Yonhap news agency.  Most North Korean escapees make their way through China and Southeast Asia, rather than attempting to cross the heavily guarded border between North and South Korea.

"President Trump has found a new favorite Twitter target. His name is Bruce Ohr, he works in the criminal division of the Justice Department, and though you may never have heard his name, the president has tweeted about him nine times since August 11. Before Trump started tweeting, Ohr, a former associate deputy attorney general (until December 2017), was largely anonymous to the general public. But within some conservative circles, his purported involvement in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign and possible Russian interference in the 2016 election has been the stuff of a great deal of theorizing over the past few months. That theorizing has now reached Trump himself: Will Bruce Ohr, whose family received big money for helping to create the phony, dirty and discredited Dossier, ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions “Justice” Department? A total joke! Now Ohr might lose his security clearance. He is facing a congressional hearing into what he knew about Christopher Steele and the dossier Steele helped to create. And Trump is repeatedly focusing attention on an employee within his own administration. So who exactly is Bruce Ohr, and why are he and his wife, Nellie, at the center of a firestorm that began in conservative media and has exploded onto the president’s Twitter feed? The big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele’s many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony & discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary & the DNC.... Bruce Ohr is a longtime Department of Justice employee. Until December 2017, in fact, he had two jobs within the DOJ: associate deputy attorney general, serving under Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein; and director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF). But in December, he was demoted from associate deputy attorney general. The Justice Department didn’t detail the reasoning for the demotion, telling Fox News, “It is unusual for anyone to wear two hats as he has done recently,” but observers on the right assumed the real reason had to do with Ohr’s purported connections to the Steele dossier. The Steele dossier is a document that alleged Trump was under the influence of Russian intelligence services, who had also compiled blackmail material on him. Steele was working for a company called Fusion GPS, founded by a former Wall Street Journal journalist named Glenn Simpson. And though the FBI began to examine ties between Trump and Russia after George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide, told an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information on Hillary Clinton, many on the right believe the dossier was responsible for the launch of the Russia investigation. Ohr met and emailed multiple times with Steele, who had been on the FBI payroll in the past as a source. According to emails revealed by the Hill earlier this month, contact between Ohr and Steele went on for more than a decade, from 2002 to 2017 — including after the FBI suspended its relationship with Steele because he shared information with the media. Also, Bruce Ohr’s wife Nellie Ohr, a Russian history expert, worked as a contractor for Fusion GPS on Russia-related matters in mid-2016 — a fact that Bruce Ohr didn’t share on federal disclosure forms. Most of this has been public knowledge since late last year, after Simpson, the Fusion GPS founder, testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee in November 2017 about the creation of the Steele dossier and how much involvement Simpson and Fusion GPS had in the FBI’s investigation of the Trump presidential campaign’s potential Russia ties. In his testimony, Simpson said he met with Ohr after the election to provide information about how the dossier was made. However, as the Weekly Standard’s Eric Felten pointed out, his testimony took place before news broke about Nellie Ohr’s work with Fusion GPS, and Simpson didn’t mention the connection. Ohr was also mentioned in Rep. Devin Nunes’s heavily hyped memo, which alleged that the FBI abused its power in surveilling Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. The memo details how Steele told Ohr that he “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.” Among many on the right, the implication is clear: Ohr’s involvement, whether via his meetings with Steele or through his wife’s work for Fusion GPS, casts aspersions on the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, and taints the investigation itself. But according to Rosenstein, Ohr has never worked on the Mueller investigation or the 2016 surveillance of Carter Page, the Trump foreign policy adviser. Even the Nunes memo doesn’t imply that Ohr knew anything about surveillance applications or any of the other fine-grain pieces of the investigation itself. As my colleague Andrew Prokop wrote in February: The memo reveals that Steele was in contact with Ohr and that in September 2016, Steele shared some of his negative opinions on Trump. ... Yet note what the memo does not claim: that Ohr had anything to do with the surveillance application on Carter Page. Yes, it tries to imply that, by saying Ohr “worked closely with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein,” who were previously mentioned as approving the wiretap. ... But Yates and then Rosenstein were top justice officials overseeing basically everything in the department. Ohr was a subordinate of theirs, but his actual job was as the “Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces Director.” If he was involved in the Page wiretap specifically, Nunes sure doesn’t provide the evidence to show that. The reason, then, that the Ohr story has persisted in conservative media and finally made its way to Trump’s attention isn’t because conservatives know anything definitive about Ohr — what he did or didn’t know about the Russia investigation or Fusion GPS, or what he knew about his wife’s work with the firm. It’s because of optics. Ohr has helped back up a conservative case that the Russia investigation as a whole is an example of the unequal application of the rule of law. As Kimberley Strassel at the Wall Street Journal wrote on August 16, the Ohr case “smells of ... impropriety.” It feeds a narrative on the right that the Mueller investigation is ignoring actions performed by the Clinton campaign or the Obama administration that, they argue, might be just as bad, or worse. By not disclosing his wife’s job in federal disclosure forms and continuing to meet with Steele even after the FBI stopped working with him, Ohr has, in effect, made the DOJ and the Mueller probe look bad, said Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a contributor to National Review who has written extensively on Ohr. “Ohr has done nothing to clear up the impression that while initially the fourth-ranking official in the Trump DOJ, he was communicating with an apparently discredited FBI informant to traffic in or add to the contents of the dossier well after the campaign,” Hanson said. “The lack of transparency on the part of a DOJ official in areas outside his normal purview is disturbing.” Hanson argued that Ohr’s lack of professional involvement with the Russia investigation makes the situation worse, not better: “He was meeting with a disgraced FBI informant on matters that did not seem to have anything to do with his assigned tasks at DOJ,” he said. After being demoted from deputy assistant attorney general, Ohr was demoted again in January, losing his title of head of the OCDETF. And he’s stayed quiet — he hasn’t commented on Trump’s tweets, or the constant barrage of criticism from the White House, including being among the officials mentioned by press secretary Sarah Sanders as at risk of losing their security clearances. But others haven’t. As the administration has threatened former government employees with having their clearances revoked (and already has revoked the clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan), retired military and intelligence officials have widely criticized the revocations, which they view as being politically motivated. After serving the nation most use security clearances (and their trustworthiness) to contribute to national defense or to help US industries maintain an advantage. This isn’t really that hard to understand, except to those who only think about financial gain. https://t.co/SntNvhHeaw For Ohr, who is a current DOJ employee, losing his clearance wouldn’t just be detrimental to his reputation but (even though he does have some job protections as a civil servant) would most likely result in the loss of his job entirely — raising the stakes of Trump’s tweets. And it’s worth mentioning that much of the criticism Trump has aimed at Ohr has really been intended for Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice overall, stemming from Trump’s continue ire that Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation and a belief that the DOJ — the one manned by Trump’s own appointees — is being deeply unfair to him and should be focused on “Crooked Hillary.” As he tweeted on August 14, “If we had a real Attorney General, this Witch Hunt” — meaning the Mueller investigation — “would never have been started!” “They were all in on it, clear Hillary Clinton and FRAME Donald Trump for things he didn’t do.” Gregg Jarrett on @foxandfriends If we had a real Attorney General, this Witch Hunt would never have been started! Looking at the wrong people. Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud, as is the rigged investigation he started. There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia, and everybody, including the Democrats, know it. The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary, the Democrats and the DNC!",bruce-ohr-explained.txt,drew.uq
"Arquetopia, which has locations in Puebla, Oaxaca, and, soon, the Peruvian city of Cusco, encourages resident artists to ask tough questions about colonialism, exoticism, and ethics. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads PUEBLA, Mexico — In the baroque capital of Puebla, an artist-run residency is attempting to challenge preconceived notions about tradition and context through a program focused on encounters and process, rather than production. Puebla was a hub for international trade and a seat of power, equal to or greater than Mexico City in riches during the 16th and 17th centuries, becoming what’s known today as ‘the city of churches,’ Mexico’s capital of baroque architecture. Here, Arquetopia instructs artists on the history of colonialism through programs combining traditional processes and academic readings. The residency’s Puebla headquarters hosts up to 12 artists at any given time, offering studio space, a natural pigments laboratory, a library, and a stocked kitchen. To date, artists from about 60 countries have made their way through the residency program, where local artists are also included in various projects as part of the mission of the founding directors. As Arquetopia’s residency and academic offerings have grown in popularity since its founding in 2009, the program has expanded from its headquarters in Puebla to a second space near the state capital of Oaxaca. A third space will open soon in Cusco, Peru, expanding the scope of the organization’s regional dialogue about history and decolonialism. At Arquetopia, artists are pushed to ask tough ethical questions about the nature of hybridity, exoticism, and their own ways of seeing. At a time when artists are grasping for forms of resistance beyond traditional protests, the thinkers working with Arquetopia offer an alternative pedagogy. I recently sat down with co-executive director Francisco Guevara at Arquetopia in Puebla (where, full disclosure, I was a writer in residence in June and July of 2016), to talk about what makes the program unique as a residency invested in shared responsibility and resistance to power. *  *  * Devon Van Houten Maldonado: “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house” — I’ve heard you say this a million times. How is this statement by Audre Lorde central to Arquetopia’s program and mission? Francisco Guevara: Although we use different scholars and different readings with different focuses, most of them are used to understand a complex history and how that plays a role when you’re in a residency program. That specific reading is the one that usually strikes the artists and really changes them, in a positive way or in a negative way. It’s racially charged, of course, also in terms of gender and other things. Basically, what we share with Lorde is that, no matter what you do, you have to be aware of the structure. You can’t just romanticize the margins, or you can’t just think about the center as the enemy, because there is no center. We create these structures. I always mention and summarize it, in terms of artistic practice, as a shadow, and as long as you keep the shadow visible then you will be able to tackle the problem. DVHM: You touched a little bit on artists’ emotional reactions to the residency; what makes this such a charged experience for many of them? FG: Our residency isn’t about just producing but about actually stepping back and looking at the process, and the process is loaded with things you might not know or aren’t aware that you’re carrying with you. So it’s very emotional because it’s not just me dictating what it should be, but also a series of authors that are in dialogue and it becomes very emotional because it taps into deep problems. One of the things that I always try to get artists to step away from is this idea about how we share these same experiences. We don’t. Something very important is the integrity of differences. We can eventually cross paths in terms of the struggle and the problems, but we come with different perspectives. DVHM: What is Arquetopia’s pedagogy, beyond the traditional model of offering space, time, and critique? FG: The most important aspect of our residency is the encounters. Mexico has traditionally been the tropical paradise where anything is possible and everything is exotic. To this day, every famous Mexican artist who sells work outside of Mexico explores and uses these ideas that have historically been built around Mexico. We read Emmanuel Levinas’s theory of encounters and empathy — understanding empathy as a process that’s so complex, but tries to erase differences, and hinders the possibility of change. The difference in our program is precisely the encounters. We’ve had artists from Israel and Palestine here at the same time, or from the north and south of the United States, and they don’t share any of the same problems. However, we find a space where encounters can be renegotiated in terms of race, class, and gender. DVHM: Is it about creating empathy between artists, or between artists and the spaces they are working in? FG: It’s actually about destroying empathy because empathy has masqueraded the problems. When we talk about humanism — we’re all the same, and we share the same experiences — that’s false. We have to acknowledge the integrity of differences, and we need to preserve that integrity. Historically, those differences have been erased to enslave people, to conquer people, and to expand the empire. Now that capitalism is so prevalent and it’s organizing everything, we’ve learned that empathy is the possibility of understanding differences by putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. That’s not only impossible, but you’re actually crushing the other by trying to be in his shoes and understand a reality that is impossible for you to understand. It doesn’t mean that you can’t connect and you can’t negotiate. DVHM: Thinking about residencies, especially in Mexico or other “exotic” locations, there is the idea of going somewhere to produce work and live among the natives. So considering the residency as a sort of “exotic” location, the production of contemporary art in centers, and the Eurocentric production of academic knowledge, what’s the discussion happening here within Arquetopia about the centers and margins of art? FG: It’s very relevant to what’s happening now because there is nostalgia. Even “make America great again,” it really captures the feeling of the world. It’s not only in the United States. It’s happening in Europe. It’s happening in Latin America. It’s happening everywhere, this idea of going back to pre-globalization spaces. Interestingly enough, it’s also going back to how the empires expanded to be able to enjoy disfrutar, meaning taking the fruit from something, taking everything. That idea has seeped into the contemporary art market. That’s why Mexico is a hot spot. Everything that shouldn’t be accessible and available or even comprehensible in other spaces is available in Mexico. It is very colorful. It is very attractive. It also really feeds into the imagination of someone who has never been exposed to different epistemologies. One of the things I say to artists when they get here — because they usually come from a tradition where time is money — is that in Mexico, time is not money. That epistemological understanding or concept of time really changes everything. When you don’t think of money and time as being the same, it allows for something completely different. DVHM: What about the specific context of Arquetopia in Puebla? FG: Puebla has never been on the map, except during the colonial period. However, it makes for a very interesting space for a residency program because we’re not in the capital of the empire, Mexico City. We aren’t in the dominant structure that connects with the gallery circuits. We’re in a different space with complexities that are very different. But that has allowed us to connect with local structures and inform the rest of the country in terms of material culture. It’s about process, not necessarily the market. It’s a program that has always operated based on reciprocity, innovation, shared responsibility, and local networks. DVHM: How about the context of your residency space in Oaxaca and the next space, which you will be opening in Cusco, Peru. FG: Going into Oaxaca was very complex. It’s a different language and way of operating. We decided to move the residency program to the mountains; it’s 30 minutes away from the city and this had a profound impact on the way artists are producing. To understand the traditions of Oaxaca you have to understand the environment, you have to be rooted in a community that isn’t just tourism. Peru was an eye-opening experience because it really completes the picture. Many of the techniques that we have in Puebla are similar, however with a very different language. Peru has a whole different set of challenges about how Europeans had a presence in Cusco. Some of the techniques there are in dialogue with Puebla and with Oaxaca. Many of the scholars whose work we use to understand these complexities and encounters have studied Peru as well. So completing this picture of the 300 years of history that Peru and Mexico share will allow us to have a dialogue regionally. DVHM: Your residency is unique in that you offer programs specific to certain traditional crafts, techniques, and materials. What’s the role of material and tradition in Arquetopia and the dialogue happening here? FG: These traditions were rooted in different possibilities that allowed many communities to survive through time and created infrastructure and elements of performativity that are important to identity. Sharon P. Holland describes it as how the West controls time, and how every speech about progress is about moving through time, and technology moving forward. Any other speech that isn’t about the West is about tradition. It’s about how we have the responsibility to preserve tradition, meaning we’re stuck in space. Being stuck in space allows those who control time to move forward and occupy our space.

"This article originally appeared on Noisey UK.  There's a certain feeling that ripples through your body when you hear a song that, to put it simply, slaps. It can be a swinging lurch in your belly, a goosebumps-creating shudder or the sense that someone's grabbed you by the shoulders and won't stop shaking you repeatedly—but, you know, in a good way.  As an instrument, the human voice makes a light flicker on in our minds—its the recognition of empathy, the comfort of now-woolly memories of your parents speaking to you when you were a baby, the bristling discomfort of a raised voice or one choked with panic.  But it's something else entirely to be able to do that with instrumentals alone. We've already written about the grime instrumental and its legacy in a genre that's come to be defined by the spitting, cajoling, winking voices of its most-respected MCs and rappers. Then you have someone like Shredda, a producer who's been quietly layering the beats over which the likes of Jammer, Shorty, P Money, and Footsie have rhymed in recent years. Shredda was responsible for the beats on both ""A Fun One"" and ""Bags Under My Eyes"", off P Money's 2015 album Money Over Everyone 2, and they're among the five songs he's putting out on his forthcoming Horrific Injustice EP. You can have a listen to it here now, before it's due to drop on Sunday 12 February. ""Listening to grime beats is something I enjoy doing,"" he tells us, ""but unlike house music and dubstep, instrumental grime doesn't get as much attention—although it's the most diverse genre. This is something I want to change."" And here's the way he plans to do it, with strings samples, beats that jump like popping candy and synths colliding over one another.

"Paul Ryan says Obamacare replacement bill should actually help older Americans more  Paul Ryan says Obamacare replacement bill should actually help older Americans more  House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Sunday that he’s looking to change the current version of the GOP replacement for Obamacare because the bill needs to do more to address the healthcare needs of older Americans. “We believe we should have even more assistance — and that’s one of the things we’re looking at — for that person in their 50s and 60s because they experience higher healthcare costs,” Ryan told host Chris Wallace during an appearance on “Fox News Sunday.” Ryan said that lawmakers are changing the bill to provide better tax credits for older Americans — and added that they’re also considering whether to allow states to institute a work requirement for Medicaid. Ryan’s appearance came in the midst of mounting skepticism about the plan among rank-and-file Republicans. According to Reuters, a senior Republican lawmaker claims there are currently 40 “No” votes in the House. Assuming no Democrat is going to vote in favor, Republicans could afford only 21 dissentions if the bill is to pass and move on to the Senate, where it also faces considerable opposition.

"To understand how influential K-pop is worldwide, look no further than social media. The 26th birthday of Jin, the singer-songwriter of Korea’s pop supergroup BTS, was by far the top Twitter trend globally Monday, garnering more than a million tweets. The Melon Music Awards, which honor Korea’s most popular musical acts, took place Saturday, and they too dominated Twitter as fans of groups like BTS, Blackpink, Mamamoo, and iKon gushed about the show. With roots in the 1990s, K-pop — a mix of pop, rap, electronica, and other genres with a South Korean twist — is affecting far more than social media trends and billboard charts. Fans of the music are taking up charitable causes, and according to the global fashion search engine Lyst, they are also wearing the same designers as their beloved K-pop idols. In its “Year in Fashion” report, which tracked more than 100 million searches from 80 million shoppers across the globe in 2018, Lyst identified K-pop stars as “major global fashion influencers.” It credits these performers with spiking searches related to brands like Moschino and Chrome Hearts after wearing them this year. 181201 Melon Music Award [HQ]Mon coco , Mon soleilI love all of you Taehyung.#뷔 #태형 #V #BTS⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠ #방탄소년단@BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/4e8jaN4MnM The omnipresence of K-pop fans on social media around the world is fueling the trend as well as the importance of visuals in the genre. Bright colors and bold prints are the norm when it comes to K-pop acts, who have made fads of the most mundane (and unexpected) pieces of clothing. A campaign T-shirt from Rev. Jesse Jackson’s failed 1988 presidential run became a must-have in South Korea this year after rapper Moonbyul of Mamamoo wore it. And the introduction of makeup lines for men is largely due to K-pop, since many members of the boy bands use “guyliner,” lip tints, and brow fillers; it’s no coincidence that South Korea reportedly makes up 20 percent of the global men’s cosmetics market. As K-pop’s influence spreads, it has shaped fashion trends in a way music hasn’t seen since the genesis of American hip-hop, when brands like Adidas, Kangol, and Jordans became must-haves for listeners. Designers, according to Lyst, would be wise to embrace K-pop’s impact on fashion, an almost certainly lucrative move. Most followed K-Pop Girl Groups on Instagram:1. #BLACKPINK - 13.657M2.

Pristin - 611k pic.twitter.com/M42QrnhNfY K-pop stars’ fashion sensibilities haven’t been lost on American publications like Vogue: The magazine named Sehun of the group EXO the “best-dressed man” at Louis Vuitton Resort’s 2019 show in May. It was the second consecutive year that Sehun received the shoutout from the magazine, which highlighted his “fuzzy mohair sweater with bold stripes” and the “red and white woven into each detail” of his outfit. The mix of textures and bold colors in Sehun’s outfit is representative of the K-pop look, in which artists lean toward vivid hues, sensual fabrics, and showy patterns. Lyst also mentioned Sehun’s appearance at Louis Vuitton in its “Year in Fashion.” Camilla Clarkson, the communications manager for the platform, told me fans’ social media activity plays a role in why the public has become so interested in what K-pop stars wear. “K-pop’s influence on fashion has been growing rapidly over the years alongside the rise of social media,” Clarkson said. “ No part of their life is too small for fans to tweet, vlog, or ’gram about. As a result, we’ve seen more global searches and sales this year than ever before, with fans desperate to get as close to the stars as possible.” Since fans can’t actually get to know the K-pop acts they idolize, buying the same items they buy is a way for them to feel connected to these stars. “Many of them aspire to imitate their favorite K-pop idols by dressing like them, so they use fashion search engines … to buy or seek inspiration from the exact pieces their idols are wearing,” Shelley Li of the K-Style Files, a database of K-pop fashions, told me. Lyst found that K-pop’s influence has spread across both women’s and men’s fashion, with boy bands like BTS and EXO and women K-pop stars like CL and Park Bom all driving fashion trends. And a group like BTS can inspire both men and women to dress like them. When rapper Suga from the group wore a checked shirt designed by Virgil Abloh, searches for it increased 120 percent, according to Lyst. The same occurred when RM, another BTS rapper, wore a pink Adidas number; searches for pink T-shirts rose by 97 percent. Li credits the globalization of K-pop music with its growing influence on fashion trends. As K-pop fans have spread from South Korea to countries such as South Africa, the Philippines, and the United States, the fashions its stars wear have more eyes on them and, thus, more copycats. But Li and Clarkson say the specific visuals associated with the music also play a role. “K-pop comes in a visually stimulating package — high-production music videos and performances with vibrant sets, lighting, and, of course, fashion,” Li said. Clarkson describes K-pop music videos as pushing boundaries and said that each artist is expected to have a distinct fashion sense. “K-pop music videos are a fantastic, slick operation,” she said. “They push boundaries and highlight that too much is never enough — from bright, colorful hair and makeup to trend-defying fashion. Each star, or ‘idol,’ as they’re known in Korea, has a unique personality and style.” While K-pop stars have received plenty of praise for their style, their sartorial choices have sometimes sparked controversy. In November, BTS drew criticism for wearing hats bearing Nazi symbols during a photo shoot. Three years ago, the group faced a similar controversy after taking part in a photo shoot at the Holocaust memorial in Berlin. The Simon Wiesenthal Center also pointed out that BTS has performed onstage waving large flags that looked similar to the Nazi swastika. Just last month, a scheduled TV appearance featuring BTS was canceled because one member reportedly wore a shirt that included an image of the atomic bomb dropping on Japan. The Simon Wiesenthal Center subsequently declared that BTS owed both the Japanese people and victims of Nazism an apology. “It is clear that those designing and promoting this group’s career are too comfortable with denigrating the memory of the past,” said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, director of Global Social Action at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, in a statement. “The result is that young generations in Korea and around the world are more likely to identify bigotry and intolerance as being ‘cool’ and help erase the lessons of history.” It’s unclear how much BTS knows about what the imagery on their clothes symbolizes, or if the group members dress themselves. After the controversies over the group’s clothing in November, Big Hit Entertainment, the agency representing them, issued an apology, stating it “had no intention of causing distress or pain” to those affected by the atomic bomb or by Nazism: The incident was in no way intentional, and although all apparel and accessories used during the photoshoot had been provided by the publication conducting the shoot, we would like to offer our sincere apologies for inadvertently inflicting pain and distress to anyone affected by totalitarian regimes in the past by failing to strictly review the clothing and accessories that our members were made to wear, as well as to anyone who may have experienced distress and discomfort by witnessing an association of our artists with imagery reminiscent of political extremism. Clearly, with international fame comes even more responsibility for a supergroup like BTS to dress in a way that takes into account how certain imagery may be read by a wide range of audiences. Still, the fact that BTS has dominated worldwide trends on Twitter during the first few days of December indicates that the controversies related to their clothing certainly haven’t curbed the zeal that surrounds the group. Camilla Clarkson predicts that K-pop and its stars will continue to dominate fashion trends next year. That means more male makeup, unconventional T-shirt choices, brightly colored hair, and bold prints — from stripes to zigzags to polka dots — and clothes featuring cartoon or video game characters. Given this, Clarkson argues that Western fashion designers in particular would be wise to capitalize on the trend. It took mid- and high-end brands years to embrace hip-hop after rappers stepped out in brands like Coach, Gucci, and Cartier. Gucci specifically has fans in rap artists like Lil Pump and in BTS alike. Predictably, it has seen more sales thanks to a boom in Generation Z and young millennial shoppers, likely influenced by these artists. For luxury fashion brands to wait as long to welcome K-pop as they did hip-hop would be a mistake, at least financially. “Western designers would do well to see [K-pop] not just as a place for inspiration,” Clarkson said, “but an area to involve themselves in to help bolster sales.” Want more stories from The Goods by Vox?

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. current account deficit increased more than expected in the fourth quarter amid declining exports, pushing the overall shortfall in 2018 to its highest level in 10 years, and U.S. companies repatriated a record amount of foreign earnings last year following the Republican tax overhaul.  The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, rose 6.1 percent to $134.4 billion. The quarterly current account gap was the largest since the fourth quarter of 2008.  Data for the third quarter was revised to show the deficit rising to $126.6 billion from the previously reported $124.8 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account deficit rising to $130.0 billion in the fourth quarter.  The current account gap represented 2.6 percent of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, the largest share since the second quarter of 2012. It was up from 2.5 percent in the July-September period.  The deficit increased 8.8 percent in 2018 to $488.5 billion, the highest level since 2008. For all of 2018, the current account deficit averaged 2.4 percent of GDP, the biggest share since 2012, from 2.3 percent in 2017.  The deficit on the current account has shrunk from a peak of 6.2 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005, in part because of a significant increase in the volume of oil exports.  In the fourth quarter, exports of goods fell 0.9 percent to $416.1 billion, while imports were unchanged at $649.1 billion.  Meanwhile, the flow of foreign profits repatriated by U.S. companies slowed to $85.9 billion in the fourth quarter from an upwardly revised $100.7 billion in the prior period, reflecting a diminishing impact from corporate tax overhaul that went into effect last January.   Earnings repatriation peaked at $294.7 billion in the first quarter immediately after the law took effect but has tailed off each quarter since. Even so, it remains well above pre-tax cut levels.  For the full year, foreign profits brought back to U.S. shores by American companies surged to a record $664.9 billion, more than four times the $155.1 billion logged in 2017 and more than twice the previous record in 2005.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - Hu Jia, a well-known Chinese dissident who lives in Beijing, says he had hoped to go to the southeastern city of Xiamen for his government-sponsored holiday, but state security officials said no.   “They told me I had to go to a more isolated place this time,” he told Reuters by phone from Yunnan province in far southwestern China, a popular destination renowned for its scenery and the culture of its ethnic minority groups.  Rights groups say that Hu is one dozens of activists and dissidents detained, placed under tighter monitoring or “vacationed” by authorities,  during the week-long congress of the ruling Communist Party which began on Wednesday in Beijing. President Xi Jinping is expected to tighten his grip on power at the gathering, which is only held once every five years.  For his enforced holiday, Hu and his two government minders jointly decided on the destinations. Hu suggested the ancient town of Dali in Yunnan for the first stop, and the public security agents accompanying him chose the second and third stops in the southwest region, Guiyang — the capital of the mountainous province of Guizhou, and the coastal city of Beihai in Guangxi province.   Hu estimated the whole trip for the three of them will cost close to 10,000 yuan ($1,510), all paid for by the authorities. He said that his minders tried to save money by choosing basic hotels and traveling between the three cities by bus.  He will fly back to Beijing on Oct 28, just after the congress ends.  “You can go see the sights, but state security goes with you everywhere,” Hu said.  Reuters was unable to independently verify the accounts of Hu and other dissidents interviewed for this story.  China’s public security ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment on the detention of activists, and the use of “vacations.” China rarely explains its treatment of dissidents other than to say that those charged are criminals who harmed social stability and that all people in China are treated equally before the law.  It is not unusual for Chinese authorities to heighten monitoring and detention of dissidents before important political events, especially people with high profiles who are  known to speak out against the party and state.  In addition to the enforced vacations, some activists have also been detained, placed under supervision at home, or warned about posting critical messages online in the weeks ahead of congress, according to the Hong Kong-based group Chinese Human Rights Defenders.   The group also said it had documented 14 cases of detention of activists in recent weeks.  In one case, Wu Kemu, a truck driver from Xuancheng city in the central province of Anhui, was called in by the police for a talk on October 11 and has not been released since, his wife Fang Liangxiang told Reuters by phone on Sunday.  “They will not say when he will be released. They just told me to wait at home for him,” she said, adding that she expected the detention was related to critical things Wu had said about the government on the popular instant messaging platform WeChat.  No one answered the phone on Saturday at the Xuancheng city detention center where Fang says Wu is being held.  It is unclear if the total number of detentions, arrests or “vacations” this year is greater than at the time of previous major events or how many of the cases are directly related to the congress.  Some activists say that the authorities prefer enforced vacations rather than detentions as they can make dissidents both inactive and inaccessible to foreign journalists over sensitive periods. Locking people up can attract more attention.  Hu, a pro-democracy activist and campaigner for those with HIV/AIDS, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail for subversion in 2008, and said he has been under regular state surveillance since his release.  “The first thing I did was go for a run up in the mountains by Dali, because I knew the state security agents could not run with me,” he said, adding that the agents were “not the running type.”  “It felt like being briefly free from prison,” he said.  Hu said that state security agents had shown him a list of people who would not be allowed to stay in Beijing over the 19th Party Congress, including Liu Xia, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.      Liu Xia has been under effective house arrest in Beijing since her husband won the Nobel Prize in 2010. After his death in July, even the sporadic communications she’s had with friends have been nearly entirely severed, two of them told Reuters.  The public security ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Liu Xia’s situation.  Some activists make their own travel plans to avoid the authorities.  Wu Lihong, an activist from Wuxi city in Jiangsu province who for over a decade has been protesting pollution in Lake Tai in eastern China, told Reuters that Chinese state security had called him last week saying they were coming to take him for a forced vacation. Wu, though, had already gone to visit a friend in Zhejiang province, on the east coast and far away from Beijing, to avoid them.  “At the 16th, 17th and 18th Congresses I was vacationed, imprisoned, held at home and forbidden to speak,” Wu said.   “This time, I chose to go on holiday without them,” he said.  He said that state security officials had asked him to return to Wuxi so they could take him on “vacation” themselves, but he declined saying he would stay with his friend till after the congress ends. He is now avoiding their calls.  Reuters could not independently confirm Wu’s comments.  Chinese state security does not have a public phone number, fax number or website.      Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on rights lawyers and activists since coming to power in 2012, jailing dozens, in what rights groups say is a coordinated attempt to quash dissent in China.  New internet measures include rules that hold users accountable for critical posts even in private group chats and a renewed crackdown on technologies to circumvent restrictions.   Kit Chan, director of the Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group, said that some recent detentions of activists represent a new direction in the crackdown as it shows the authorities are targeting smaller groups that draw attention to specific rights issues as much as their traditional focus on pro-democracy activists.  Zhen Jianghua, for example, the founder of Human Rights Campaign in China, a grassroots organization based in the southern province of Guangzhou, was detained on Sept 1 in Zhuhai, a source close to Zhen who declined to be named told Reuters.  The ministry of public security did not respond to a faxed request for comment about the targeting of grassroots organizations. A person who answered the phone at the Zhuhai public security bureau said she was not aware of Zhen’s case.

"2:30 PM PT -- POTUS has authorized the FBI to begin the Kavanaugh investigation that Sen. Flake called for right before the Judiciary Committee voted to recommend confirmation. Several other Senators demanded such an investigation during Thursday's testimony, and Flake suggested the investigation should only delay the full Senate vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation by a week. President Trump ﻿is one huge step closer to getting his guy, Brett Kavanaugh ﻿on the Supreme Court -- the Senate Judiciary Committee just voted 11-10 to recommend he be confirmed. The Committee has 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, so the tally comes as no shock -- even after Thursday's emotional day of testimony from Kavanaugh and his sexual assault accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. The next step for Kavanaugh is the confirmation vote before the full Senate. Before he cast his vote recommending confirmation, Sen. Jeff Flake came face-to-face with two sexual assault victims who confronted and cornered him in an elevator on Capitol Hill. The incident might have had some impact -- before the Committee voted, Sen. Flake requested the Senate vote be delayed for one week to let the FBI conduct an investigation. However, the Committee voted to recommend confirmation ... and did NOT insist on the one-week delay. Emotions have been running high since Thursday's nearly 9 hours of testimony. Two other women -- Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick -- also levied allegations but were not allowed to testify. Ford recounted Kavanaugh's alleged attack on her at a house party when they were in high school. Kavanaugh followed, and vehemently denied the allegations ... seemingly coming unhinged at times. The Senate is expected to vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation next week. If, as expected, he's confirmed, he'll become Trump's second Supreme Court appointee... joining Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed last year for the high court.",senate-judiciary-committee-recommends-brett-kavanaugh-to-supreme-court.txt,drew.uq

The two shooters were killed by police in the aftermath. Apple is fighting the order, citing concerns about the precedent that this would set in future cases in the United States and elsewhere. The FBI responded by slamming Apple's lack of cooperation as a cheap marketing ploy. The global technological consensus is against the FBI. Why? Here's one example: — Edward Snowden (@Snowden)March 8, 2016 Snowden referred to a blog post on the American Civil Liberties Union website to support his view. The post, written by Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a technology fellow at the ACLU, says: ""The truth is that even if this feature is enabled on the device in question, the FBI doesn't need to worry about it, because they can already bypass it by backing up part of the phone (called the 'Effaceable Storage') before attempting to guess the passcode."" He explains that the auto-erase function doesn't actually wipe the phone of its content. Instead, it deletes the ""file system key"" that is kept in the iPhone's effaceable storage, which is basically a flash memory file. ""The FBI wants us to think that this case is about a single phone, used by a terrorist,"" Gillmor writes. ""But it's a power grab: law enforcement has dozens of other cases where they would love to be able to compel software and hardware providers to build, provide and vouch for deliberately weakened code.""

Related: Bill Gates Says the FBI Only Wants to Unlock One iPhone — But There Are 12 Other Cases FBI privacy and surveillance rules are subject to reevaluation and certification each year. In 2014, according to an annual report published by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Group (PLCOB), the FBI was, very quietly, given direct and mostly unlimited access to NSA files containing enormous collections of metadata — international emails, texts and phone calls — many of which had an American citizen on one end of the phone or computer. The watchdog group was established by President Barack Obama in the aftermath of the Snowden leaks to assuage public concern about mass surveillance. US officials confirmed this to the Guardian this week. Those rules reportedly meant FBI officials were at liberty to scroll through the data for ""routine"" queries that have nothing to do with national security, and did not require authorities to disclose or make a record of who and what they were searching.  Because identifiable information in the NSA data set isn't redacted, the FBI effectively had access to information that it would otherwise have needed sa a warrant for.  The PCLOB annual report has repeatedly expressed concerns over the FBI's apparently unlimited access to American's private communications. In the latest report, the PLCOB noted that some of that power had been reined in in response to concerns about ""many"" FBI agents who had access to NSA data. In the most recent PCLOB report, the secret court that governs surveillance had reportedly submitted ""revised FBI minimization procedures"" in response to the watchdog's concerns. ""Changes have been implemented based on PCLOB recommendations, but we cannot comment further due to classification,"" Christopher Allen, a spokesman for the FBI, told the Guardian. Details of the changes made to FBI access of NSA information haven't been released. Timothy Barrett, a spokesman for the office of the director of national intelligence, said the changes will be released eventually but said they couldn't provide a date just yet.

"In case you missed it, aviation security officers forcibly removed a man from an overbooked flight on Sunday while other passengers filmed the shocking altercation. The man—who has since been identified as doctor David Dao—was dragged from his seat on a United Airlines flight headed to Louisville, Kentucky, from Chicago, and appeared to have been knocked out, his mouth full of blood. The security officers proceeded to pull his body down the length of the aircraft's walkway and off the flight.  United's CEO Oscar Munoz responded by sending a letter to his employees that was leaked to the media. While Munoz said he was ""upset to see and hear about what happened,"" he added that the passenger was ""disruptive and belligerent."" Ultimately, Munoz stood behind his employees, saying that the passenger refused to voluntarily leave the plane, with staff ""left with no choice but to call Chicago Aviation Security Officers to assist in removing the customer from the flight."" The airline earlier said that it was investigating what happened after videos of the incident provoked an angry response on social media.  One of the passengers, Jayse D.

"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Many expect 2016 to be the year that virtual reality (VR) finally takes off. And indeed, recent developments signal that, this year, VR will finally go from being a buggy, vertigo-inducing prototype — an exhilarating idea executed poorly, and most accessible to industry insiders — to a viable platform, and a soon-to-be widely available one at that. Last week Oculus, a trailblazer in VR technology, opened preorders for the consumer version of its Rift display system, shocking many with its high initial price point of $600. The Facebook-owned company is not without competition — HTC, Playstation, and Microsoft are rolling out consumer models of their own, and Google’s VR project is firmly under development. Prices for these latter models are as of yet unknown, while Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has already responded to criticism of his system’s prohibitive cost, promising that it will eventually drop. Although these VR systems are being marketed primarily to the gaming community, developers are already exploring possibilities beyond blowing virtual holes in living room walls. For instance, the Oculus Rift will ship packaged with “Medium,” a toolkit for sandbox experimentation with forms, allowing users to manipulate shape, color, light, and texture à la MS Paint updated to 3D (the HTC Vive will run a similar software called “Tilt Brush”). The prospects presented by a new medium in its infancy are surely as daunting as they are appealing — their technical capabilities seemingly unbounded, their formal possibilities unexplored, and their aesthetic criteria undetermined. Third-party developers and artists have already begun tapping into this potential in a number of ways, by building aesthetic sensoria with rigorous 3D modeling, rendering animated worlds that users can engage with far more viscerally than in an ordinary video game, and by adapting cinema’s moving images from the 2D screen to the 360° arena, thrusting the spectator into the very movement of a documentary or fiction. Without a doubt, VR’s repercussions for older, more familiar notions of cinematic realism are astounding. The mortality of cinema is a topic that has been endlessly ruminated on; the advent of VR makes clear that it’s not cinema’s death that is demanding of reflection, but rather its afterlife in new and different media. Sensory Stories, an exhibition mounted last year at the Museum of the Moving Image, presented several Oculus-powered works, hinting at some of the paths moving-image artists may pursue as they increasingly turn their attention to the new frontier of VR. Herders (2014), by Félix Lajeunesse and Paul Raphael, is a VR documentary that unobtrusively observes the daily lives of several Mongolian nomads. The work, owing to the technology it makes use of, grants the viewer the ability to scan hilly vistas in any direction, and the sheer act of being able to look over your shoulder while remaining within the frame of the seamless panorama breeds an intense, vertiginous wonder. VR works are multifocal by default, and Herders is no exception — at any given moment you can gaze at the horizon, eye a musical performance, or spy an old man eating in the corner of a tent. Works like these urge the viewer to decide for themselves what is worth focusing on, often resulting in an intensely voyeuristic viewing experience. What at times is bewitchingly, subtly real in Herders can also acquire a pronounced social aspect. As the viewer is enclosed in the movement of the work — as though truly present, for example, at the herders’ family dinner — empathetic identification with the subjects is heightened to a degree only graspable if experienced firsthand. This displacement of the viewer’s own perspective, coinciding with the adoption of that of another, is a function of VR that will no doubt be used and abused, and will likely spark a heady revival of debates — aesthetic and otherwise — about the politics of spectatorship. Indeed, it doesn’t take a great deal of cynicism to see this technology being gobbled up wholesale by the entertainment-military complex and being catered, for example, to the arms and defense sector, providing immersive, photorealistic combat training programs to militaries the world over. Nonetheless, VR is an astounding technology, and its being made available to the consumer public — as well as to artists, teachers, and other prospective developers and users — will be a groundbreaking event in the unfolding procession of new media.",the-virtualreality-future-is-here.txt,drew.uq

"Billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel is a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump; he is also the man who helped bankrupt Gawker media. In the tech and media worlds, that essentially makes him Public Enemy No. 1. On Monday Thiel set out to defend himself. At an hour-long press event at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Thiel answered a bunch of questions about everything from his million dollar donation to Trump’s campaign to his multi-million dollar donation to Hulk Hogan’s lawyers. Thiel said a lot, so we’ve pulled out some of his more interesting quotes here. We’re still sifting through everything, and will add more as we go. On whether or not his support of Trump has hurt his business: “Not in any meaningful way. ... It certainly has generated a tremendous amount of discussion. I’ve gotten a lot of pushback from people, to say the least. But I think my friendships, close working business relationships, I think all those are very well intact.” On Silicon Valley’s disconnect with the rest of the country: “The story people in Silicon Valley always want to tell is the one in which their specific success as individuals and as companies gets conflated with a story of general success and general progress in the United States. ‘So we’re doing well, therefore our whole civilization is doing well, everybody’s doing well, the whole country’s taken to the next level.’ That’s the narrative people love to tell — specific success linked to general success. I think the truth has been one of more specific success, but more general failure.” On his $1.25 million donation to Donald Trump, which came shortly after Trump faced backlash for a tape in which he admitted to grabbing women inappropriately: “I think the tape was in extremely poor taste, extremely inappropriate. I didn’t even think as much about the donation as I should have. My general perspective on this year was that money actually didn’t matter that much. The candidates who raised the most money on the presidential level did incredibly badly. I didn’t even think that Trump needed my money. He hadn’t raised that much money, they didn’t ask me for money, I hadn’t donated. So when they asked me I wasn’t sure they needed it, but I thought I’d go ahead and write them a check. But I didn’t think that much of this connection. Of course, I didn’t think anybody would think that you would donate to a candidate because of the worst thing they’ve done. You support candidates normally because of the things you like about them, not the things you dislike.” On whether or not Trump would try and repeal LGBT rights if elected President: “I have not had conversations with Mr. Trump on that specific subject. I do think he represents a sea change from the Republican party of [George W.] Bush. You just look at the way Bush was speaking about gay marriage at every single campaign event in the 2004 election. Everything [Trump’s] indicated is that he’d be quite expansive on gay rights.” On whether Thiel supports a ban on Muslims coming to the U.S., a stance Trump has campaigned on: “I don’t support a religious test. I certainly don’t support the specific language Trump has used in every instance. I think one thing that should be distinguished here is that the media always is taking Trump literally. It never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally. I think a lot of the voters who vote for Trump take Trump seriously but not literally. So when they hear things like the Muslim comment, or the wall comment, or things like that, the question is not, ‘are we going to build a wall like the Great Wall of China?’ or ‘How exactly are you going to enforce these tests?’ What they hear is ‘we’re going to have a saner, more sensible immigration policy.’” On why he funded Hulk Hogan’s sex tape lawsuit against Gawker, and why he kept it private: “I got involved over a number of years and it was one of these things once you got involved, you started to believe in the justice of the case more and more because there were so many different people you interacted with who had been destroyed, in most cases it was not super prominent people, or super wealthy people. It was people who could not afford to do anything. And one of the striking things was that if you’re middle class, if you’re upper middle class, if you’re a single digit millionaire like Hulk Hogan, you have no effective access to our legal system. It costs too much. This was the modus operandi of Gawker in large part, to go after people who had no chance of fighting back. ... My judgement was Mr. Hogan deserved to have his day in court.” On whether or not he set a dangerous precedent by suing Gawker media into bankruptcy: “I don’t think so. Let’s start with the facts of the case. It involved a sex tape. If you make a sex tape of someone with their permission, you are a pornographer. If you make a sex tape without their permission, we were told now, you are a journalist. I would submit that as an insult to all journalists. This is not about the First Amendment, it is about the most egregious violation of privacy imaginable.” On whether or not wealthy, powerful people should be able to sue a media organization for a story they disagree with: “Wealthy people shouldn’t do that. I think if they try they won’t succeed. Gawker was a pretty flimsy business. It was a bad business, it didn’t make that much money. They could have withstood all the lawsuits. They lost because of the enormous verdict that came in against them. That’s why they lost at the end of the day ... I was very careful in the Hulk Hogan litigation in picking a lawsuit where the fight was over privacy. We did not even bring a libel action because that was sort of the way I wanted to make clear in the Hogan case that it was not about the media more generally.” On whether or not he’s currently suing any other media organizations: “I’ve been involved in the Gawker case and nothing else.” This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",here-are-all-the-things-peter-thiel-said-about-donald-trump-and-gawker-on-monday.txt,drew.uq
"Former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig has been detained while visiting Beijing.Kovrig was detained Monday night during one of his regular visits to the city, according to a source.The detention comes after China warned Canada of consequences for its recent arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.It's unclear if there's any link between the two cases. TORONTO (AP) — A former Canadian diplomat has been detained while visiting Beijing, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday. Michael Kovrig was detained Monday night in Beijing during one of his regular visits to the city, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to speak publicly on the matter. The detention comes after China warned Canada of consequences for its recent arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver's airport. It's unclear if there's any link between the cases. The Globe and Mail in Toronto and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. had earlier reported Kovrig's detention, also citing unnamed sources. The International Crisis Group said earlier Tuesday it was aware of the reports that its North East Asia senior adviser had been detained. The Hong Kong-based Kovrig had served as the political lead for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's trip to that city in 2016. The Brussels-based non-governmental organization said in a statement that it was doing everything possible to obtain additional information about Kovrig's whereabouts and that it will work to ensure his prompt release. The International Crisis Group said Kovrig has been one of its full-time experts since February 2017.The organization's website says Kovrig previously worked as a Canadian diplomat in Beijing and Hong Kong and at the United Nations. Canada's Global Affairs department didn't immediately respond with comment. Former Canadian Liberal leader Bob Rae said it's clear why he's been detained. ""It's called repression and retaliation,"" Rae tweeted. Kovrig wrote on his LinkedIn profile that he had served as the political lead on a visit Trudeau made to Hong Kong in September 2016. He worked in Canada's consulate-general in Hong Kong at the time. Roland Paris, a former foreign policy adviser to Trudeau, said that Chinese ""retaliation against Canadian interests or Canadians would be unacceptable and pointless."" ""It would have zero impact on judicial proceedings in Canada,"" Paris tweeted. ""Beijing should already know this from previous experience. Let cooler heads prevail.""

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House officials believe Chief of Staff John Kelly’s personal cellphone was compromised, raising concerns that hackers or foreign governments may have had access to data on the phone, Politico reported on Thursday.  The suspected breach could have happened as long ago as December, Politico reported, citing three U.S. government officials.  Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, joined the Trump administration in January as secretary of Homeland Security. He became White House chief of staff in July.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.  Politico reported that the suspected breach was discovered after Kelly turned his phone over to White House tech support this summer complaining that it was not working or properly updating software.  It was unclear what, if any, data may have been accessed,  Politico reported.  Politico reported that a White House official said that Kelly had not used the personal phone often since joining the administration, instead relying on his government-issued phone for most communications.

"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Ivory Coast has launched a new strategy to end child labor in cocoa farming and other sectors by raising women’s incomes and building schools, the government said on Wednesday.  The plan is more wide-reaching than previous ones and aims to tackle household poverty as the root cause of child labor, said Patricia Sylvie Yao, executive secretary of the national committee for the fight against child labor and trafficking.  “Today we have decided to expand our actions,” said Yao.   “What we plan to do is help empower women, because experience shows that when a woman has an income-generating activity, it reinforces the wellbeing of the family,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, launched its first national action plan against child labor in 2012, but the problem remains widespread in poor farming communities.  An estimated 890,000 children work in the cocoa sector, some for their parents and some trafficked from abroad, according to a 2018 report by anti-slavery organization Walk Free Foundation.  Thousands of children also work in mines or as domestic servants, said Yao.  The new action plan, the country’s third, will run from 2019-2021 at a cost of 76 billion CFA Francs ($132 million).   A cocoa industry representative said it goes further than previous strategies by tackling issues such as supply chain traceability and illegal plantations in protected forests.  “This one I think does a more intensive job of looking across the Ivorian government and taking into account what the whole of government is doing,” said Tim McCoy, vice president for country relations at the World Cocoa Foundation (WCF).  Measures such as empowering women and investing in education may not seem directly linked to child labor, but do have an impact, he said.      Ivory Coast has rescued 8,000 victims of child labor since 2012, but more needs to be done to strengthen police capacity, said First Lady Dominique Ouattara at a launch event on Tuesday.   Last year it improved efforts to eliminate human  trafficking but fell short of the minimum standards, particularly regarding law enforcement, according to the U.S. State Department’s annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report.  Government officials were complicit in trafficking and police did not have enough resources to investigate cases, said the report, released last week.

"ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - Aggressive U.S. tactics such as a campaign against Chinese telecoms firm Huawei will lead to trade wars - and possibly real wars - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday, in a show of solidarity with China alongside its leader Xi Jinping.  In some of his strongest words on the subject, Putin accused Washington of “unbridled economic egoism”. He singled out U.S. efforts to thwart a Russian gas pipeline to Europe and a U.S. campaign to persuade countries to bar Huawei, the world’s biggest telecoms equipment maker, from supplying network gear.  His broadside, at an economic forum in St Petersburg on the same platform as Xi, was a clear show of unity with China at a time when Beijing is locked in a trade war with Washington and Moscow’s own ties with the West are at a post-Cold War low.     “States which previously promoted free trade with honest and open competition have started speaking the language of trade wars and sanctions, of open economic raiding using arm-twisting and scare tactics, of eliminating competitors using so-called  non-market methods,” said Putin.  “Look for example at the situation around Huawei which they are trying not to just squeeze out, but to unceremoniously push out of the global market. It’s already being called the first technological war of the emerging digital era in some circles.”  The world risked slipping into an era when “general international rules will be exchanged for the laws of administrative and legal mechanisms ... which is how the United States is unfortunately behaving, spreading its jurisdiction over the whole world,” added Putin.  “...It’s a path to endless conflicts, trade wars and maybe not just trade wars. Figuratively speaking, it’s a path to battles without rules that pit everyone against everyone else.”  Putin also complained about the U.S. dollar, calling it an instrument of pressure whose role in the financial system should be reconsidered.  China’s Xi struck a more conciliatory tone, calling for world powers to protect the global multilateral trade system. Speaking through an interpreter, he said it was “hard to imagine a complete break” between the United States and China.  “We are not interested in this, and our American partners are not interested in this. President Trump is my friend and I am convinced he is also not interested in this,” Xi said.  Russia has long complained about Western sanctions imposed on it over disputes including its behavior in Ukraine. Moscow casts the restrictions as an attempt to contain its growth.  Washington has asked countries to reject Huawei technology in the development of new mobile phone networks, arguing that it could be vulnerable to Chinese eavesdropping. Huawei denies its equipment is a security risk.

" In a move to better support the more than 3,000 Indigenous communities in Canada, Google has announced the addition of data reflecting band and reserve territory into the Google Maps and Google Earth software platforms. GIF: Google Canada  The news comes on National Aboriginal Day, which recognizes and celebrates the culture of Indigenous peoples. (As of next year, it will be renamed National Indigenous Peoples Day.) About 1.4 million people in Canada self-identify as Inuit, Métis, or First Nations. With the change, Indigenous people who search for their homes and territories will be able to see borders and overlays of the large parts of the country which are Indigenously administered.  There are a bunch of compelling reasons why these places should be represented in the cold, hard data of maps.  ""Colonial understandings of land quite often come down to relationships to maps,"" said David Gaertner, who teaches topics like Indigenous new media at the University of British Columbia, and was not affiliated with Google's project. These changes come during Canada 150, a controversial celebration of the country's 150th anniversary, one that many Indigenous peoples have been resisting as marking 150 years of colonialism. Indigenous Lands in Google Maps: Canada  ""In the wake of Canada 150, the nationalism is just rampant,"" said Gaertner. ""I think it has a way of getting in the way of these conversations. We've seen some pretty tough stuff come up recently around the cultural appropriation debates. And I think, in a lot of ways, a lot of settler Canadians have proven themselves not to be ready for these conversations.""   Read More: This Augmented Reality App Tells Indigenous Stories in Canadian Cities  According to a Google blog authored by Tara Rush, Kanien'kehá:ka from Akwesasne, the update came after seven years of collaboration with Indigenous communities in Canada. Google partnered with The Firelight Group's Steve DeRoy, a cartographer and part of Ebb and Flow First Nation in Manitoba.  ""It's important to me because there are so many Indigenous groups across the country and to not see them as an important fabric of a base map, just to not be recognized, it's insulting,"" he told the CBC.  In Google's blog, DeRoy explained that Indigenous peoples felt underrepresented in their mapping software after participating in Indigenous Mapping Workshops.   There are certain cartographic elements still missing. A future update with details like the unceded Algonquin lands in Ontario (on which Ottawa, the nation's capital, sits) could be an important way to acknowledge the historical nature of Canada's geographic relationship with Indigenous peoples.

"A program on March 18–19 will look at how video art and psychotherapy both bred narcissism in the 1970s. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Have you ever considered the points of intersection between early video art and psychotherapy? No? Well, why not start this weekend, with a program exploring the topic at EFA Project Space. “Surrounded by Me” looks at the adoption of video in the 1970s in both artistic and clinical psychotherapy practices. As the event’s organizers, artist Tyler Coburn and art historian Robin Simpson, write: “Where Nancy Holt utters, ‘I am surrounded by me’ in Boomerang (1974), as she negotiates the echoes of her voice fed back through a headset, so a colleague of [psychotherapist Milton M.] Berger’s, facing a fleet of cameras and monitors, remarks, ‘I feel surrounded by myself.’” The primary connection there, Coburn and Simpson argue, is narcissism, and the way it played out in these fields and across our larger society. In an attempt to investigate this overlap, and perhaps others, the pair has planned an evening and an afternoon of presentations and screenings at EFA. On Saturday, pediatrician Felix Rietmann, cultural historian Judith Rodenbeck, and Simpson himself will speak. On Sunday, video psychotherapy training tapes from the 1970s will share a lineup with artworks by Richard Serra and Nancy Holt, Howardena Pindell, Sadie Benning, Coburn, and others.

"LIMA (Reuters) - Former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori sought forgiveness from Peruvians “from the bottom of my heart” on Tuesday for shortcomings during his rule, and thanked President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski for granting him a Christmas pardon.  In a video on Facebook, Fujimori, 79, vowed that as a free man, he would support Kuczynski’s call for reconciliation, hinting that he would not return to politics.  “I’m aware the results of my government were well received by some, but I acknowledge I also disappointed other compatriots,” the ailing Fujimori said, reading from notes while connected to tubes in a hospital bed. “And to them, I ask for forgiveness from the bottom of my heart.”   The remarks were Fujimori’s first explicit apology to the Andean nation that he governed with an iron fist from 1990-2000.  They came after two days of unrest as protesters slammed the pardon as an insult to victims and part of a political deal to help Kuczynski survive a scandal.  The pardon cleared Fujimori’s convictions for graft and human rights crimes during his leadership of the rightwing government.  Late on Monday, Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, appealed to Peruvians opposed to the pardon to “turn the page” and defended his decision as justified clemency for a sick man whose government helped the country progress.  “I cannot keep from expressing my profound gratitude for the complex step that the president took, which commits me in this new stage of my life to decidedly support his call for reconciliation,” Fujimori said.

"Obamacare open enrollment starts on November 1, and President Trump is using Twitter to blame Democrats for premium increases, and promising yet again to repeal the health care law. As usual, the ObamaCare premiums will be up (the Dems own it), but we will Repeal & Replace and have great Healthcare soon after Tax Cuts! Do Democrats “own” the rising rates, though? Not if you ask the health insurers and policy experts who have set and study those premiums. As Vox documented in great detail, premiums on the law’s marketplaces were expected to stabilize this year, as insurers finally adjusted to the customers who were buying coverage. Single-digit rate increases, on average, were anticipated. It wasn’t perfect, but the law was reaching an equilibrium. But then Trump intervened. He sowed uncertainty about whether the law’s individual mandate would be enforced. He cut funding for advertising and enrollment outreach. Then the president stopped key cost-sharing payments to health insurers, which compensate companies for offering discounts on out-of-pocket costs to their lower-income customers. Insurers had warned they would hike rates as a result.

"LONDON (Reuters) - One in five people in war zones has depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday, with many suffering severe forms of these mental illnesses.  The findings highlight the long-term impact of war-induced crises in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen, the UN’s health agency said, and the numbers are significantly higher than in peacetime populations, where around one in 14 people has a mental illness.  “Given the large numbers of people in need and the humanitarian imperative to reduce suffering, there is an urgent need to implement scalable mental health interventions to address this burden,” the research team said.  Mark van Ommeren, a mental health specialist at the WHO who worked on the team, said the findings “add yet more weight to the argument for immediate and sustained investment, so that mental and psychosocial support is made available to all people in need living through conflict and its aftermath”.  In 2016, the number of ongoing armed conflicts reached an all-time high of 53 in 37 countries and 12% of the world’s people are living in an active war zone, according to United Nations figures. Since World War Two, almost 69 million people globally have been forced to flee war and violence.  The WHO’s conflict mental health study, published in The Lancet medical journal, was carried out by a team of researchers from the WHO, Australia’s Queensland University, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and Harvard University in the United States.  It analyzed research from 129 studies and data from 39 countries published between 1980 and August 2017.   Regions that have seen conflict in the last 10 years were included and mental illnesses were categorized as either mild, moderate or severe. Natural disasters and public health emergencies, such as Ebola, were not included.   Overall in war zones, the average prevalence was highest for mild mental health conditions, at 13%. Around 4% of people living amid armed conflict had moderate mental health illness, and for severe conditions the prevalence was 5%.  The study also found that rates of depression and anxiety in conflict settings appeared to increase with age, and depression was more common among women than men.  The study was funded by the WHO, the Queensland Department of Health and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc said on Tuesday it would not join a lawsuit FedEx Corp filed against the U.S. government that argues FedEx should not be held liable if it inadvertently shipped products in violation of an export ban.  FedEx’s announcement of its suit on Monday came shortly after the U.S. parcel delivery firm reignited Chinese ire over its business practices. A package containing a Huawei phone sent to the United States was returned last week to its sender in Britain, in what FedEx said was an “operational error.”  Chinese telecoms company Huawei Technologies Co in May was added to a blacklist of people and companies the U.S. government said posed a security risk, barring it from buying, without special approval, U.S. technology upon which it was heavily reliant. A number of other Chinese firms have also been banned from buying sensitive U.S. technology.  In its lawsuit, FedEx said it should not be expected to enforce the export ban, and could not reasonably be held liable for shipping products that it did not know about.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that the regulation stated that carriers must not knowingly ship items in contravention of the rules. “It does not require a common carrier to be a policeman or to know what’s in every package,” he said.   UPS said in Tuesday’s statement it would continue to follow government directives across the markets where it operates.  Last month, China said it would launch an investigation after two parcels sent via FedEx destined for Huawei addresses in Asia were diverted to the United States. FedEx said the packages were “misrouted in error.”  In the latest incident, technology news outlet PCMag said that its writer in Britain had attempted to send a Huawei P30 handset to a colleague in the United States. FedEx returned the phone and told the sender that it could not deliver the package because of a “U.S. government issue” with Huawei and the Chinese government, PCMag reported.  FedEx’s lawsuit and Chinese anger over the deliveries come against a backdrop of increasing tension between the world’s two biggest economies.   Eric Hirschhorn, a former U.S. undersecretary of Commerce, said the lawsuit suggests “the company is caught in the middle between China and the U.S. They’re being squeezed by two governments that are annoyed at each other and they’re trying to do their business.”  Reporting by Rachit Vats in Bengaluru, Chris Sanders in Washington and Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Maju Samuel and Rosalba O'Brien",ups-will-not-join-fedex-lawsuit-against-us-government.txt,drew.uq

Carrey has yet to respond to Alessandra, though she has continued to spar with his defenders and other critics of fascism on Twitter.  Alessandra is already quite famous in Italy, where she’s been a politician for years. Her sympathies for (and even dabblings in) fascism are well-documented. She once abruptly left an Italian political party because its leader denounced fascism as the “absolute evil.” She was also a prominent face of Italy’s 1990 neo-fascist movement. There’s also the time in 2006 when she responded to a transgender critic who called her a fascist by saying: “Meglio fascista che frocio,” which roughly translates to “Better fascist than faggot.” Alessandra also appears to be a fan of President Donald Trump. She frequently retweets Trump and defended him against Carrey’s numerous political cartoons that target the president. Carrey even recently held an exhibit in New York depicting his work.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended flat while the Dow edged down and the Nasdaq closed higher in light trading on Friday as Canada and the United States concluded trade talks without resolution ahead of the Labor Day weekend.  Capping a low-volume, late-summer week marked by tariff-related volatility, all three major U.S. indexes posted net gains for the period. The indexes were also up for the month of August, with the Nasdaq posting its largest monthly gain since January.  Talks between Canada the United States to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ended on a sour note as the two sides were unable to reach a deal, according to the Wall Street Journal.   In recent days trade jitters abated as Mexico and the United States reached a bilateral deal, but re-emerged later in the week following a report that U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports as soon as next week.  “We may not have a replacement for NAFTA as quickly as we thought,” said John Toohey, head of equities at USAA in San Antonio. “That initial optimism that existed at the beginning of the week, that good news scenario is off the table.”   Amazon.com’s shares (AMZN.O) continued to inch upward, rising 0.5 percent as investors watch the company close in on its $1 trillion market share milestone.

"TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan has tightened curbs on exports of high-tech materials used in smartphone displays and chips to South Korea, upping the ante in a decades-old dispute with Seoul over South Koreans forced to work for Japanese firms during World War Two.  The export curbs highlight how Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, continues to hold sway over a vital corner of the global supply chain. It remains a major player in specialized chip components, even though it was overtaken as a chipmaker years ago by South Korea.  Below are some details about the materials targeted, the companies involved, the outlook for further curbs and the row itself:  The tighter export curbs target three materials: fluorinated polyimides, used in smartphone displays; photoresists, used to transfer circuit patterns on to semiconductor wafers; and hydrogen fluoride, used as an etching gas when making chips.  Japan produces about 90% of fluorinated polyimides and about 70% of etching gas worldwide, Japanese media have said. It produces around 90% of photoresists, according to a government report. That makes it difficult for South Korean chipmakers to find alternative sources of supply.  South Korea imported $144 million of the three materials from Japan in the first five months of this year, accounting for 94% of its fluorinated polyimides, 44% of its etching glass and 92% of its photoresist, Korean industry data showed.   A source at one of South Korea’s top memory chipmakers said chipmakers would have to try to build stockpiles.  South Korean tech giants such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and LG Display are all expected to be hit.  Japanese suppliers include JSR, Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Shin-Etsu Chemical and Stella Chemifa. Other suppliers include Showa Denko KK and Kanto Denka Kogyo, analysts say.  South Korean chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix rely on Japan for most of the materials, although they source some hydrogen fluoride from China. They have up to four months of stockpiles for some of the materials, according to experts.  “The materials are hard to build stockpiles of because photoresists, for example, can deteriorate over time,” said Nomura analyst Shigeki Okazaki. Likewise, etching gas is hard to store in high volumes, he said.   Japan is stopping preferential treatment for shipments of these three materials to South Korea and will require exporters to seek permission each time they want to ship, which takes around 90 days, a government official said.  South Korean chipmakers are now seeking to buy more from elsewhere, such as China or Taiwan, where Japanese jurisdiction can’t reach, according to Park Jea-gun, a semiconductor engineering expert who heads the Korean Society of Semiconductor & Display Technology.  Japan also plans another round of export curbs for South Korea that could target a broader range of items applicable to weapons production, including machine tools, the government says.   Specifically, it plans to remove South Korea from a “white” list of countries with minimum trade restrictions, requiring Japanese exporters to go through a lengthy permit application process each time they want to export restricted items to South Korea, it said.  On Japan’s white list are 27 countries, from Germany to the United Kingdom and the United States. South Korea, which was added in 2004, would be the first country to be removed.  Tokyo has been frustrated by what it calls a lack of action by Seoul over issues stemming from a top South Korean court ruling last October that ordered another Japanese company, Nippon Steel, to compensate former forced laborers.  The neighbors share a bitter history dating to the Japanese colonization of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including forced use of labor by Japanese companies and the use of comfort women, a euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels.  Japan says the issue of forced labor was fully settled in 1965 when the two countries restored diplomatic ties.   South Korea has denounced Japan’s moves as a violation of World Trade Organization rules, saying it would take the necessary countermeasures, including filing a complaint.  Japan has said the moves are not in violation of WTO rules.  Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Nick Macfie",the-hightech-trade-dispute-rooted-in-japans-wartime-history.txt,drew.uq
"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Afghan Taliban rejected reports in the Pakistani media that they were prepared to resume meetings with U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in Islamabad and repeated their refusal to deal directly with the Afghan government.  Pakistani newspapers and television stations reported that a meeting in Islamabad was in prospect following discussions between Khalilzad and Pakistani officials including Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday.      Senior Taliban leaders said that regional powers including Pakistan had approached them and wanted them to meet the U.S. delegation in Islamabad and also include the Afghan government in the peace process but that the approaches had been rejected.  “We wanted to make it clear that we will not hold any meeting with Zalmay Khalilzad in Islamabad,” Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid in a statement.  Talks between the two sides have stalled after the Taliban accused Khalilzad of straying from the agreed agenda and there is no clarity on when they may resume.  “We have made it clear again and again that we would never hold any meeting with the Afghan government as we know that they are not capable of addressing our demands,” said one senior Taliban leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The United States says any settlement in Afghanistan must be between the internationally recognized Afghan government and the Taliban, who have so far refused to talk to an administration they describe as an illegitimate puppet regime.  The Taliban leader said peace talks with the U.S. delegation could resume if they were assured that only three issues would be discussed - a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, an exchange of prisoners and lifting a ban on the movement of Taliban leaders.  Khalilzad arrived in Islamabad on Thursday and met Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan as well as the Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and other officials.   “The two sides reviewed developments post Abu Dhabi, in order to take the Afghan peace process forward,” a foreign office statement said. An Afghan Taliban delegation had a round of talks last month with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi.   The statement didn’t give any further details on the talks, but several local TV channels reported that Pakistan agreed to host the next round of talks between the Afghan Taliban and the United States in Islamabad.   Khalilzad, an Afghan-born veteran U.S. diplomat who served as George W. Bush’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the United Nations, was named by the Trump administration four months ago as a special envoy to negotiate peace.  Washington has long been pushing Islamabad to lean on Taliban leaders, who it says are based in Pakistan, to bring them to the negotiating table.  It often accuses the south Asian nation of covertly sheltering Taliban leaders, an accusation Islamabad vehemently denies.  The United States, which had more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan at its peak during the first term of former President Barack Obama, withdrew most of them in 2014 but still keeps around 14,000 there.

"HBO doesn’t have as much riding on its new sci-fi drama Westworld as reports of the show’s calamitous production (which was suspended at one point and ultimately spanned more than a year, where most TV shows finish a season in a few months) might have you believe. Rating But, boy, it would be nice for the network if the show took off. HBO hasn’t launched a new drama hit since Game of Thrones in 2011, and its recent summer success story, The Night Of, was technically a miniseries, with nobody involved being in a rush to make a new installment. And there’s something even bigger at stake here. Now that The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones have proved that adaptations of much-loved horror and fantasy material could blow up into mega-hits, it’s only been natural to assume the same might be true of science fiction. If HBO can turn Westworld — based on Michael Crichton’s 1973 movie about a futuristic theme park that recreates the Wild West, then populates it with humanoid robots, some of whom go rogue — into the sci-fi Game of Thrones, the network will have lots of freedom in the years to come. That’s probably why it tried so very hard to get this one right. And with Jonathan Nolan — creator of CBS’s ingenious Person of Interest — and J.J. Abrams, who likely needs no introduction, involved behind the scenes, Westworld has all the advantages it needs. But the show is also indicative of just how much trouble HBO finds itself in in 2016. Here are five ways Westworld exemplifies HBO’s biggest strengths and problems. The Westworld pilot is good, good stuff. It builds nicely. It introduces some cool characters. It has some neat twists and turns. And it even takes a story you already know (the aforementioned 1970s film about a theme park full of killer robots) and tells it from a new perspective. In this case, the robots take center stage, where the theme park visitors were the heroes of the original. But with every new episode (of which I’ve seen four), Westworld loses a little bit more steam. There are still plenty of interesting things going on around the edges of the frame, but the series slowly but surely develops a severe identity crisis. Is it a story about oppressed people (the robots) rising up against those who oppress them (their creators)? Is it a revisionist Western? Is it a workplace drama about running a theme park in the future? Is it just a weird rip-off of Lost, with endless mysteries to solve? That it’s all of these things and more, without ever really committing to one of them, is the series’ chief failing. HBO increasingly creates shows that combine more and more and more things, in hopes they’ll hit on the magic formula that’s made Game of Thrones so successful. But Game of Thrones has two extremely compelling ideas at its center: 1) everybody wants to sit on the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, and 2) the White Walkers are coming to kill everybody. Westworld doesn’t have those sorts of extremely compelling ideas. It has maaaaybe the suggestion that the robots will become sentient at some point down the line, and possibly the idea that the theme park employees are stand-ins for modern entertainment creators (more on that in a moment). But everything else is covered in layers of mystery and obfuscation that don’t help convey a story beyond ""Things are happening."" Evan Rachel Wood, who plays Dolores, one of the theme park’s ""Hosts"" (the artificial beings who populate the park), is giving one of the best performances on television, full stop. TV fans have known Wood was a tremendous actress since her work as a young teenager on the family drama Once and Again, which aired between 1999 and 2002 and where she found exactly the right emotional tug for every single scene she played. But Hollywood has struggled to find a project worthy of her talents since then. On Westworld, however, she’s mesmerizing. She modulates layers of emotion and levels of awareness and a slowly dawning sentience without ever once making you believe she’s anything other than an artificial intelligence. It’s magnificent work and the best reason to watch the show. The rest of Westworld’s cast is similarly stacked. There’s Anthony Hopkins as one of the men who created the Hosts. There’s Jeffrey Wright as another theme park employee, and Ed Harris as a mysterious gunslinger who roams Westworld’s wilderness and has a fixation on Dolores. Even the smaller roles are played by tremendous performers, as when the terrific Danish actress Sidse Babett Knudsen turns up in rather a minor supporting part. And because the series is an HBO project, its technical aspects are as good as TV gets. A directing team that includes Nolan, Neil Marshall (who’s helmed many of Game of Thrones’ most epic hours), and Vincenzo Natali (one of Hannibal’s chief directors) joins with top-notch cinematography that always highlights the alienness of Westworld to create something special. This is a fun show to look at, if nothing else. The Westworld pilot — without spoiling anything — backs the show into a corner it can’t really get out of. So instead of dealing with the episode’s most vital and interesting themes (particularly as pertains to the Hosts’ intelligence), the show instead spins out a bunch of pointlessly busy plot lines that feel like second-rate rip-offs of Lost. There are hidden clues and ominous portents and everything. And because Westworld insists on wrapping it all in the aforementioned layers of mystery, the show is constantly cutting between a bunch of storylines where it’s not immediately clear why anybody is doing anything, other than that the plot needs them to do certain things at certain times. One of HBO’s biggest problems in recent years is that it seems afraid of having any genuine protagonists. Instead, it creates massive, sprawling ensembles that feature lots and lots of potential protagonists. And when all of those potential protagonists have interesting things to do and compelling goals to pursue (as in Game of Thrones or The Leftovers), that approach can work. But in many cases, that much sprawl leads to a series that’s constantly leaping all over the place, without rhyme or reason. Westworld has a few noteworthy storylines, but it has even more that are hard to care about, simply because they seem to exist just to pad out the running time. Dolores is by far the most intriguing character on Westworld, but the show seems reticent to build a show around her, even though her character arc — robot slowly waking up to the horrors of her own existence — is an instantly compelling one. That’s not to say Westworld doesn’t contain anything to chew on. When it can get out of its own way, the series boasts a nicely heady mix of big ideas and sci-fi concepts. I was particularly struck by how much of the story is about the faith the characters have in learning the ""answers"" of Westworld. Even those who know this realm has been created by humans are certain there’s something more to find, some deeper revelation about the mysteries of consciousness. And for the Hosts, who spend their days executing preprogrammed routines, the slow realization of what reality truly is has even more to say about the relationship between creation and creator. There’s also a sly commentary in here on HBO itself. For the most part, the stories with the theme park employees are extraneous and unnecessary. (It’s not difficult to imagine an even more powerful story where Dolores or others discovered their ""makers"" late in season one.) But there’s frequent discussion of how visitors to the theme park want stories where every piece fits together in a satisfying fashion, or how everybody wants a little sex and violence in their entertainment. Thus these sections allow for an analysis of what we really want from our popular fiction — or what HBO thinks we want. We want things to make sense, but not be too satisfying. And we always respond best when characters are in pain. In recent years, HBO has struggled to select the point in the story where its big, serialized epics should begin. (To be fair, this is a common crisis in scripted TV.) Start too early, and you risk spending a lot of time on repetitive blandness. Start too late, and you run out of plot really quickly. As a movie that about robots waking up to their reality (in contrast to the human-centric focus of the original film), this new version of Westworld might have packed a punch. It would have been sort of a more serious, live-action version of the genre-hopping madness of The Lego Movie, with Evan Rachel Wood playing the role of the hero. But as a TV show, Westworld isn’t quite at a place where its story is moving forward, and the show knows it. The argument for Westworld’s story starting too late is in the attention it pays to its various theme park employees. As the employees learn that their robot creations are starting to understand that they are essentially slave labor, it’s easy to imagine this storyline as the end of a far longer narrative about humanity inventing its AI-driven successors, the beings that will replace it on the planet. But it’s also possible that Westworld opens way too early, at a point that should be buried in the back-story of a tale about the Host uprising, when the show presumably catches up to the killer robot shenanigans of the movie. Instead, we’re caught in a neither-here-nor-there scenario, and the show spends a lot of its time just laying everything out, hoping we’ll tag along because it’s on HBO, and we have brand loyalty to HBO. And to be honest, I do. I’ll keep watching for a little while. But even though it’s sleek, frequently thoughtful, and always cool, Westworld’s scattered self never coheres into anything. It’s a sci-fi Game of Thrones in that its many characters are spread all over the map, chasing after something grand, but it misses what made Game of Thrones work. Here, ""something grand"" is incredibly nebulous, a figment of someone’s imagination that might not even exist. We’re supposed to take on faith that the journey will be worth it. And while HBO still commands that amount of faith from most, it’s time to stop testing our patience.

Williams, at 39, is the oldest woman in the singles while fellow American Gauff, at 15, is the youngest ever to come through the qualifying tournament.  Gauff describes the draw as “a dream” and she might well wake up on Monday morning pinching herself, as this time last week she had no idea she would receive a wildcard into the qualifying tournament and was preoccupied with schoolwork.  After winning her third qualifying match to book her place in the draw, she revealed that her first memory of watching tennis on television was of Serena and Venus Williams who had won 10 Grand Slam titles before she was born.  Now ‘Coco’ as she is known will play against her idol in front of a packed showcourt crowd in a clash of the generations.  The level-headed teenager was taking it all in her stride though and if there were nerves as she practised at the weekend, she was hiding them well.  “I kind of felt like I was going to play one of them,” Gauff said. “Many people have been like ‘do you like your draw?’ — I love my draw. Playing one of the greatest players of all time is a dream — I’m excited to see how I do.”  Even 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena, who usually gets too nervous watching sister Venus, is intrigued.  “She’s so cool. She’s a great girl. I love her dad. They’re just really cool people,” Williams said on Saturday.  “It’s a great moment for her and for Venus. She’s playing against a player that actually reminds me of Venus. I think I might, might watch. I always get nervous watching Venus.”  Swiss great Roger Federer, whose management company Team 8 also looks after Gauff, is excited.  “I’m super happy for her. I saw the last couple of games when she qualified. Obviously everybody was waiting to see what the draw was going to be like. I think that’s fascinating, that she plays Venus now,” he said.  “It’s a great story. Coco is a nice girl, works really hard. I think she’s got a wonderful future ahead of her.”  Gauff, who won the French Open junior title aged 14, is coached by her father Corey who once played college basketball for Georgia State. Her mother Candi was a college gymnast.  “I feel blessed because my parents never put limitations on my goals,” Gauff said at Roehampton this week. “My parents always told me to shoot as high as I wanted to.”  Venus could be excused for feeling her age a little as she walks out to face a player 24 years her junior but Gauff does not regard her as old.  “I don’t think of Venus as old — she’s still killing the game right now,” she said.

"WASHINGTON — Special Counsel Robert Mueller might’ve wrapped up his two-year investigation into President Trump, but he’s left a dozen investigations running in his wake, at least one of which could pose serious problems for the president.  Or maybe not. All are now in the hands of Attorney General William Barr — the man Democrats accuse of acting as President Trump’s defense attorney instead of the country’s top law enforcement official. That dynamic has left Democrats clamoring for Barr to recuse himself from those probes, a call Barr has flatly refused — raising questions about whether Barr could play a role in diverting any investigation spawned from Mueller’s work that veers too close to Trump.  Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin voiced this concern after Barr’s fiery testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday.  But there's little in the regulations that suggest Barr must recuse himself, or is even supposed to consider doing so, former prosecutors and legal experts told VICE News. WASHINGTON — Special Counsel Robert Mueller might’ve wrapped up his two-year investigation into President Trump, but he’s left a dozen investigations running in his wake, at least one of which could pose serious problems for the president.  Or maybe not. All are now in the hands of Attorney General William Barr — the man Democrats accuse of acting as President Trump’s defense attorney instead of the country’s top law enforcement official. That dynamic has left Democrats clamoring for Barr to recuse himself from those probes, a call Barr has flatly refused — raising questions about whether Barr could play a role in diverting any investigation spawned from Mueller’s work that veers too close to Trump.  Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin voiced this concern after Barr’s fiery testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday.  But there's little in the regulations that suggest Barr must recuse himself, or is even supposed to consider doing so, former prosecutors and legal experts told VICE News. READ more: Barr's defense of Trump is still baffling “Barr could put his foot on the brake for these Mueller referrals, and there doesn’t seem to be much Congress could do about it,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law who specializes in the federal judicial system.  Barr’s track record of running interference for presidents under investigation — both now and 30 years ago — raises yet more questions about his impartiality in handling these additional cases. “Barr could put his foot on the brake for these Mueller referrals, and there doesn’t seem to be much Congress could do about it.” “Given what he’s said about the Mueller investigation, I think you really have to wonder about that possibility,” Tobias said.  Mueller’s probe looked specifically into Trump’s links to Russia and obstruction of justice. But his final report revealed that Mueller’s team uncovered evidence of criminal wrongdoing in 14 matters outside that scope that he referred to other officials.  Of the other matters Mueller raised the alarm on, 12 remain completely secret, having been turned over to other prosecutors or the FBI.  But one appears to directly implicate Trump: The case against Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, who violated campaign finance law on Trump’s behalf by setting up hush-money payments to women who claimed they’d had sex with Trump.  Cohen pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years in jail for actions taken “at the direction of” Trump, according to both Cohen himself and written filings by federal prosecutors based in New York.  That matter is now under the supervision of Barr, who could, in theory, block any further investigative steps meant to expose Trump’s role in the payments.  The other investigation that’s public concerns Greg Craig, who served as former President Obama’s White House counsel and was charged this spring with lying to officials about work he did on behalf of the government of Ukraine. And Barr has the power to oversee other politically charged investigations beyond Mueller’s referrals — including the Southern District of New York’s investigation into whether any foreigners improperly donated to Trump’s inaugural fund.  Then there’s Erik Prince, founder of the private militia group Blackwater and brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Prince was referred to the DOJ for possible perjury charges by the House Intelligence Committee in April after the committee announced it had uncovered six places where Prince’s testimony to Congress appeared to diverge from the findings of the Mueller report.  Barr could put his thumb on any of these, legal analysts say. And there doesn’t seem to be much that could technically stop him.  Yet if Barr weighs in too heavily on any of these investigations, he might spark a backlash from line prosecutors and others further down in the DOJ’s ranks, according former prosecutors like Gene Rossi, who spent 30 years as a DOJ employee in the Eastern District of Virginia. “Bill Barr has the authority, as the attorney general, to snuff out and stifle any investigation,” Rossi said. “But if he takes action seen as a gross abuse of power, you’ll see career prosecutors raise holy hell. They would not hesitate to leak, and tell the public that the big con is in.” That goes double for the Southern District of New York, which has a notable reputation for independence, Rossi said.  “If the attorney general tries to snuff out that [campaign finance] investigation, you’d probably see a revolt in Manhattan,” Rossi said.  When Barr appeared before the Senate on Wednesday, Sen. Kamala Harris of California pushed him to recuse himself from these cases based on what she called his conflict of interest.  “I think the American public has seen quite well you are biased in this situation and not objective, and that is the conflict of interest,” Harris said.  “Barr is fully within his rights not to recuse himself from the various investigations that spun off as a result of the Mueller probe.” Unfortunately for Harris, career prosecutors and legal experts said that’s not actually much of an argument.  “I can understand why people might feel that Barr has compromised his independence and ability to be fair in those cases based on the misleading nature of his letter, press conference and testimony before the Senate,” said Barbara McQuade, the former U.S. Attorney for Detroit. “But the standard that DOJ uses for recusal is whether the prosecutor has a financial, personal or political relationship with the subject of the investigation.” And there’s no indication Barr has any such relationship with any of these mystery investigations. Some argue Democrats’ calls for Barr to recuse from these matters are primarily political theater.  “Barr is fully within his rights not to recuse himself from the various investigations that spun off as a result of the Mueller probe,” said Joseph Moreno, a former federal prosecutor. “Not only is there nothing to indicate any actual conflict of interest, but it is a stretch to argue there is even a perceived conflict involving these various cases each of which have their own facts, targets, and timelines.” Cover: Attorney General William Barr testifies during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, May 1, 2019, on the Mueller report.

"Hoverboards were the gadget trend of holiday season 2015, with an exciting and unexpected penchant for exploding and starting fires at inconvenient times. Today, the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a recall for more than 500,000 hoverboards (a.k.a. self-balancing scooters) from 10 different brands, citing their abovementioned habit. The hoverboards recalled include the Swagway X1 (267,000 units), Powerboard (70,000 units) and all devices sold on Overstock.com (4,300 units). Earlier this year, the government said it was looking into a bunch of different hoverboard makers regarding the safety of their products. As BuzzFeed News’ Joe Bernstein observed last fall when he went to Shenzhen, the global manufacturing hub in China, a lot of corners get cut to make sure that the demand for hoverboards gets met. An estimated 400,000 hoverboards were shipped out of Shenzhen in 2015 alone. Before you go find your teenage son and pry his recalled Swagway from his cold, millennial hands, enjoy this clip of Mike Tyson falling off his hoverboard: This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",the-us-government-is-recalling-half-a-million-hoverboards-citing-explosions-and-fires.txt,drew.uq
"Family structure matters. Murphy Brown is coming back on the air, and in the time since Dan Quayle lit into her, the evidence has become fairly overwhelming that kids raised in stable two-parent households do better than those raised by solo parents. Even more strikingly, a series of research projects led by Raj Chetty and his collaborators culminating in the Opportunity Atlas shows that this happens on a community level. Poor kids have a better chance of being upwardly mobile if they grow up in a low-poverty neighborhood. They have a worse chance of being upwardly mobile if they grow up in a racially segregated environment with no white people around. And they have a better chance of being upwardly mobile — regardless of their own family situation — if they grow up in a neighborhood with a lot of two-parent households. This impact is a lot stronger for boys than for girls, which makes me think it’s probably the same role model effect that the same team found for inventors: Girls are more likely to grow up to be successful innovators if they live in a city that has a disproportionately large number of women innovators. Except instead of girls benefitting from having adult women innovators ambiently present in their lived experience, boys benefit from having responsible, married dads ambiently around in their lived experience. It’s an interesting finding. David Leonhardt chides liberals for being reluctant to talk about it. I’m not totally averse to talking about it (after all, I am talking about it now) but I’m not really sure there’s a lot to be said about it. To me, the problem with the family structure conversation is it doesn’t seem to have a clear upshot. Research tells us that lead in soil and old paint hurts kids’ chances for upward mobility in life, and so the solution is to invest in lead abatement. Research tells us that kids do better when their parents get earned income tax credit money (EITC) and so the upshot is we should invest more in EITC. High-quality preschool and highly effective K-12 teachers help kids, so we should try to do more of that. One can go blah, blah, blah down the line and come up with a policy agenda that would do a lot to help America’s kids by bolstering their families’ incomes, improving the healthfulness of their ambient environment, and putting in the work to surround them with effective educational institutions. None of this is easy exactly, but some of it is at least logistically easy. (The hard part is politics.) And even the stuff that’s logistically hard, like building high-quality preschools, is at least clearly possible. On family structure ... I dunno. When I hear conservatives talk about the importance of family structure, what I mostly hear them doing isn’t articulating a policy agenda, but articulating opposition to a policy agenda. “No, let’s not bother with that lead abatement program or EITC expansion, the real problem is absent fathers.” On Twitter, Megan McArdle suggested to me that the fix for the family structure problem is for Hollywood to become moralistic and scoldy about unmarried parents and to valorize bourgeois conventionality. Maybe that would work, maybe it wouldn’t, but either way it’s not a policy agenda. It’s a kind of anti-agenda — very typical of contemporary American conservatism — that wants to fill the political arena not with policy ideas but with vague cultural grievances. To me that doesn’t work. The problems of poverty and economic growth are important enough that we should focus energy and attention on ideas that we have a strong reason to believe will work. When someone comes to me with a policy idea that stands a shot at meaningfully altering family structure, I’ll be happy to talk about it. But until then, I don’t think abstract talk does much good. As a last word, though, I did see some liberals Thursday afternoon doing the “correlation isn’t causation” routine on this finding of the study. We really do have a lot of studies on this subject, though, and they very much suggest a causal effect. What’s more, the causal mechanism is one liberals embrace in most contexts: representation matters. That’s why dads’ presence matters more for boys than it does for girls, and that’s why it matters on a community level and not just an individual one.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Monday its farm aid package would include $4.7 billion in direct payments to farmers to help offset losses from retaliatory tariffs on American exports this season.  The bulk of the payments, $3.6 billion, would be made to soybean farmers. That amounts to $1.65 per bushel multiplied by 50 percent of expected production, Undersecretary for Farm Production and Conservation Bill Northey said on a conference call.   China has traditionally bought about 60 percent of U.S. soybean exports. But it has been largely out of the market since implementing tariffs on U.S. imports in retaliation for the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese goods.  “An announcement about further payments will be made in the coming months if warranted,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said.   The aid package, announced at $12 billion in July, will also include payments for sorghum of 86 cents per bushel multiplied by 50 percent of production, 1 cent per bushel of corn, 14 cents per bushel of wheat, and 6 cents per pound of cotton.   Payments for hog farmers will be $8 per pig multiplied by 50 percent of Aug. 1 production, while dairy farmers will receive  12 cents per hundred weight of production, Northey said.  Sign-up for the program will begin on Sept. 4, to coincide with the 2018 harvest, and end in January. Farmers will need to present production evidence to collect payments and payments are capped at $125,000 per person.   The program will also include $1.2 billion in purchases of commodities, including pork and dairy products, to be spread out over several months, Undersecretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs Greg Ibach said.   “The specific commodities to be purchased are those that have been impacted by the unfair tariffs that have been imposed by other nations,” he said.   The program will also include some $200 million for a trade promotion program to develop new markets.  The package has been seen as a temporary boost to farmers as the United States and China negotiate trade issues. It has divided Republicans, some of whom favor free trade and were troubled by what they viewed as the kind of welfare programs their party has traditionally opposed. It has also faced skepticism from some farmers, a key Trump constituency.  “Short-term aid does not create long-term market stability,” said Doug Schroeder, Illinois Soybean Growers vice chairman, in a statement after the announcement. “Producers need trade, not aid.”  Reporting by Michael Hirtzer, Caroline Stauffer and P.J.

"All photos by Daniel Morel It's an interesting moment in the life of Richard Morse, a Haitian-American musician/proprietor/vodou priest living in Port-au-Prince. Haïti is still embroiled in election turmoil and ongoing social and political unrest, while his legendary band—RAM—just released its new album, fusing ceremonial Vodou rhythms with Haitian street music and electric guitars. I'm in Port-au-Prince, late January. The occasional whiff of smoke drifts up to my hotel balcony. Like all foreigners, I've been advised not to venture out for the next couple of days due to intermittent riots, burning tires, and unforeseeable chaos. The people are upset. And they're rising up. An undecided first round of elections last October, alleged to be fraudulent, set the political scene aflame. The term of President Michel Martelly—a.k.a. konpa singer Sweet Micky—ends on February 7, and Haïti, the first Caribbean nation to revolt against its colonizers, gaining independence in 1804, is expected to elect a new president. This is all very personal to Morse, quite literally; he is not only invested in the wellbeing of the nation and his people; he is also the estranged first cousin of and former advisor to Martelly, and a vocal critic of the powers that be, both within Haïti and abroad. Richard Auguste Morse was born in Puerto Rico in 1957 to a Haitian mother, then teaching and performing dance, and an American father, who was founding the Caribbean Studies program at the University of Puerto Rico at the time. Several years later the family moved to Woodbridge, Connecticut (both parents were Yale professors, in Drama and Latin American studies, respectively). Growing up mixed race was not easy. ""It took time for me to realize that I came from a mixed family,"" Morse muses. ""I didn't know. I asked my dad if it was true. It became more of an issue when I was a teenager in boarding school; I had heard rumors that I was of mixed race, because that's when you have to choose social camps."" Morse's next stop was Princeton, where he joined a Caribbean-style punk-rock band called Groceries. The band lived in Belle Mead, New Jersey (right outside Princeton), in a farmhouse converted into a rehearsal/living space after graduation. ""My musical education took place at CBGB's, Max's Kansas City, and a great new age/punk/rock club in Trenton, New York, called King Tut's City Gardens, where we became a house band, and played with UK bands like the Thompson Twins and Flock of Seagulls,"" he recalls. ""Removed"" from the band in 1984 for being ""an uncompromising artist,"" Morse moved to New York City, where he began working with Steve Rubell, of Studio 54 fame. ""I learned things from Steve Rubell... Most importantly, to infuse all that you do with art, business, and music,"" recalls Morse. In 1985, after a period of bohemian New York living, mingling with the likes of Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat, Morse wanted to get back into making music. Morse is actually a third-generation Haitian musician; Candio, his maternal grandfather, was a twoubadou (Kreyòl for troubadour, a singer-composer), and his mother, Emerante de Pradines, is an established singer, recording several albums of Haitian roots music in the 1950s (now 97, she is in the process of opening a music and arts school in Port-au-Prince). ""My mother sang the same songs we perform with RAM, but with an operatic voice and an acoustic guitar,"" says Morse. He'd always been fascinated with the music and culture of his motherland, and so at 28, he picked up and moved to Port-au-Prince, intending to explore the rhythms of Haitian roots music as a source of inspiration. Smitten with the music, the land, and its people—his people—Morse has been there ever since. Once in Haïti, Morse ""didn't know where to start."" Soon after arriving, the country went into political upheaval, and ruthless dictator “Baby Doc” Duvalier fled. ""The military took over, and there were a lot of shootings, things I'd never experienced before."" While immersing himself in Haitian culture and rhythms, ""an ongoing process that continues to this day,"" he had a dream: ""Someone came up to me and gave me a crazy message. I tried to investigate the dream once I woke up, and went to Jacmel [an old port town], where I met Madame Nerva, a renowned vodou priestess, who insisted I spend time with her."" The process of his initiation into vodou began, culminating in his ordination as a priest circa 2001. Back in 1987, Morse took over the lease for the legendary Oloffson, an enchanting but dilapidated hotel. His restoration efforts included staging art shows and hiring local traditional dance groups, finally choosing the one that would eventually become RAM. Morse fell in love with one of the singers, Lunise Exume; they married, had two children, and together still run the hotel, which has hosted numerous celebrities over the years, including Mick Jagger, Graham Greene, and Jackie Kennedy Onassis. The Oloffson is not only their home but the venue for RAM's electrifying Thursday night performances. With the official creation of RAM (Richard's initials) in 1990, Morse became the songwriter and Lunise began leading the female vocalists. Conceived as a roots band, influenced by the ""mizikrasin"" (roots music) movement that became popular in Haïti following Duvalier's exile, RAM combined ancient African rhythms, ceremonial vodou, and traditional folk music with rock 'n' roll. Incorporating traditional vodou lyrics and instruments (rara horns, petwo drums), and singing in Kreyòl, French, and English, it was a perfect combination. In its 26 years of existence, RAM has toured throughout Haïti and North America (including a concert with Arcade Fire). In 1993 RAM contributed to the Philadelphia soundtrack. ""Jonathan Demme was collecting Haitian art and doing Haitian documentaries at the time, did a Haitian compilation album. We had just completed our first recording, and I sent him a cassette. That's how it was in those days: cassette tapes. He loved the music and put it on the soundtrack,"" Morse explained. The fourth generation, Morse's son, William, recently joined the band. ""He grew up with RAM, and used to come on tour with us."" It was a natural progression for the young guitarist. Morse is politically outspoken, critical of Haitian, American and international powers, expressing his views openly on Twitter and other platforms. He resigned from his post as advisor to the President in December 2012, realizing Martelly was ""not on board,"" more interested in personal gain than in the recovery and well-being of his country. ""Do you ever feel you're in danger?"" I ask. ""I always get into trouble,"" he replies. ""I have political opinions. That can sometimes be a tipping point. But I try not to think about personal safety."" And there's the music itself. Some songs carry implicit political messages, such as ""Ambago"" (off RAM 1: Ayibobo), addressing the US embargo. ""Our songs are metaphors, not intrinsically political,"" explains Morse. ""People interpret the metaphors to be political. The first song that had political ramifications was ‘Fèy,’” recalls Morse. RAM added the instrumentation to the ceremonial lyrics and melody, and ""once it was released, it went from being a ceremonial song to a political song."" I ask if it was the people who made that leap. ""Yes,"" he says. ""And we suspected that they might."" The lyrics, paraphrased: I'm a leaf on a branch.A bad storm came and knocked me off the branch.The day I fall is not the day I die.And when they need me, where are they going to find me?. . .Papa, My Good Lord and Saint Nicholas,I only have one son, and they made him leave the country ""The people interpreted the bad storm as the military coup, and the leaf as [Haiti's first democratically elected president] Jean-Bertrand Aristide,"" explains Morse. ""There's no actual politics in the lyrics themselves, but when you put the words within the context of a coup d'état and throwing out a person beloved by the people... the connection was made."" Morse and the band paid a price for expressing political dissent, even if only implied. ""We received a lot of persecution and intimidation when that song became popular; there were rumors that I was machine-gunned to death, that my wife had been kidnapped. Military and police came into the hotel, and there were physical threats, coming in many different ways,"" he recalls. RAM just released its sixth and strongest studio recording, RAM 6: Manman m se Ginen. It's the first in ten years, mixed by Grammy-winning record producer Andrew Weiss. When I ask about the album's subtitle, Morse explains that ""in Haitian vodou, the heritage gets handed down from generation to generation, and the person it gets handed down to is a Ginen. My mother is a Ginen—an inheritor of this tradition."" And so is Morse. RAM 6 draws on the African culture and traditions that live on in Haïti; this diverse, compelling set features ancient texts (""Koulou Koulou"" is part of the traditional Haitian prayer ""La Priye Djô""), deities (the black top hat-wearing cemetery keeper and lord of death, healing and procreation on ""Mon Konpe Gede""), driving rhythms, traditional percussion and the distinctive sound of rara horns (check the opening ""Papa Loko (Se Van)"", celebrating the patron of healers and plants); but it also draws from other forms of popular Haitian music, mashing it up with a rock sensibility and electric guitars. Tradition is honored, preserved, and innovated all at the same time, uplifting the people during these troubled times. There's a long line of people waiting to get into the Oloffson and catch RAM live. I'm lucky enough to be in Port-au-Prince on a Thursday night and catch this sizzling 14-piece band in action. The night begins with a traditional vodou ceremony. Ten dancers dance to the same ceremonial rhythms that RAM will later make music to, presented as dance choreographies, without eclectic accompaniment. ""My mom did it throughout my childhood, singing and dancing to these rhythms"" recalls Morse. ""And now my wife does it, and I do it""—and so the tradition continues. Before the dancers begin, the ground is ""dusted"" with cornmeal, creating Veves—the spirits' ""coat of arms."" The ceremony has an entertainment aspect to it, ""but it's also educational,"" explains Morse. ""The more people know about the traditions, the more they enjoy the music. The more you find out about it, the deeper it gets."" Around midnight, the show begins. Morse's ponytail is let loose, his white mane unleashed, as are the spirits in the room. The music and palpable, infectious energy build, the rum flows, and the dance floor fills with sweaty, dancing, gyrating bodies, elated faces. RAM's shows draw not only hotel guests, but a wide spectrum of the country's political and racial groups, all sharing in this one-of-a-kind experience—hypnotic drums, transfixing horns, shredding guitars, riveting dancers. Spirits are soaring. Weeks later, back in North America, I catch up with Morse by phone. He is excited about the new RAM recording and its enthusiastic reception, and cautiously hopeful about the prospects of true Haitian democracy. There’s an interim government in place, working on forming an electoral council to organize the elections. “Martelly and the US State department want a second round to the first, but the population wants election verification, which might change the results. They're investigating all kinds of drug deals and irregularities, making Martelly and the US nervous,"" reports Morse. “This government appears to have good intentions, in spite of how it came into being.” And RAM is in the thick of it. “We've been around a long time. We're kind of the soundtrack for historical moments.” Cop RAM 6 here, and if you happen to be in Port-au-Prince on a Thursday night, you know where you need to be.

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pushed backed on Thursday against Canadian concerns that gas pipeline contracts awarded under his predecessor might not be honored, saying the terms of the agreements were “abusive” toward the state.  Mexican state power utility CFE [COMFEL.UL] said this week it would negotiate a “fairer” resolution to contractual disputes over several pipelines being built by companies including Mexico’s IEnova (IENOVA.MX) and Canada’s TC Energy Corp (TRP.TO).  The Canadian ambassador to Mexico, Pierre Alarie, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that the Mexican government appears “not to wish to respect natural gas pipeline contracts,” and said he was deeply concerned about the signal being sent.  Lopez Obrador, who in February vowed the contracts would be honored, said it was natural for Alarie to defend Canada’s interests but took a defiant stance when asked about the dispute during his regular morning press conference.  “Here it was stated that those contracts were abusive. I called them unfair contracts because they were handed over with all the benefits for the companies,” Lopez Obrador said, arguing that their terms would lead to the ruin of the CFE.  “A deal will be reached because we too have to defend the assets and the interests of the Mexican people,” he added.  The row has revived concerns that Lopez Obrador’s government could put in jeopardy contracts signed under previous administrations, the last six of which the president has characterized as part of a corrupt “neo-liberal” era.  He has been highly critical of the government of predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto, who sought to lift economic growth by opening up the energy sector to private capital, an approach that Lopez Obrador has so far roundly rejected.    IEnova, a unit of U.S.-based Sempra Energy, says the CFE is seeking arbitration over a contract it signed in partnership with TC Energy to build a $2.5 billion pipeline from Texas to the Mexican Gulf coast port of Tuxpan.  News of the arbitration request dragged down IEnova’s shares more than 4% on Wednesday. The company’s stock at one point slumped by over 8% on Thursday. Shares in Sempra were down 1.1%, while stock of TC Energy was up slightly.  Paty Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Sempra, said the company was analyzing the content of the arbitration request and its legal basis, reaffirming it was ready to talk to the CFE.  “The arbitration notice should not interfere with the existing contractual conditions,” she said.  A CFE source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the utility had notified Fermaca, a Mexican infrastructure company building another pipeline, that it was seeking arbitration. Fermaca could not immediately be reached for comment.  Separately, Mexico’s Grupo Carso, an infrastructure firm controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim that also is involved in the pipeline disputes, said in a statement it would analyze an arbitration request it had received from the CFE.  Shares in Carso fell by 2.25%.  Lopez Obrador rejected the suggestion that the spat could interfere with ratification of United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a new North American trade deal the Mexican Senate approved earlier this month.  Canada and the United States must still ratify USMCA.  Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, alarmed investors by canceling a partly built $13 billion Mexico City airport, arguing that it was riddled with corruption.

"Snapchat has raised $175 million in new venture funding from Fidelity at the same $16 billion valuation it raised at back in May, according to a source familiar with the deal. That means Snapchat has now raised around $1.4 billion in total. The Wall Street Journal first reported the new funding. A flat valuation isn’t usually a great sign, but the raise comes at a time when lots of tech companies — including Jawbone and Foursquare — are raising down rounds, or taking money at a lower valuation than their last fundraising. In that vein, this investment doesn’t look bad. A Snapchat spokesperson did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

" In a year that felt explosive, due to in no small part to violent attacks in a public spaces and further increases to surveillance technologies, Beijing-based artist Li Wei created Secure for Now, a sculpture that questions current global perceptions of safety. Composed of fiberglass and oil paint, the statue emulates a blonde-haired, blue-eyed child with his arms hidden behind him and a little white dog by his side. Viewed from the front, the boy looks calm but vacant, tricking viewers who fail to peek behind the sculpture and find the grenade cradled in his hands.  “From certain points of view, crisis is caused by humans,” Wei tells The Creators Project. “Personal crisis is a crisis, too, and it is often from [personal crises] that a public crisis actually originates. When personal turns into public, I think that is when the real crisis happens. It is in the many details of our human lives that the sparks of crisis lie hidden, but unfortunately most people cannot or do not want to see them.”  Following the attacks of September 11, Wei became a documentarian of similar catastrophes, from a fire in a Shanghai high rise in 2010, to the massacre at Paris' Bataclan last year. The parallels between these disasters, for Wei, whom The Creators Project profiled back in 2012, is the chaotic flow of information and its use as a springboard for paranoia, often manifested as adversity towards the Other. Wei plays with this notion in Secure for Now, arguing that a small boy and his dog are the least likely sources of threat, according to mainstream narratives. Within the work, the artist strives to change perceptions of disasters and their perpetrators.  “A crisis doesn’t care about borders, and it doesn’t care whether they are regarded as big or small,” Wei says. “It is hard to imagine that the relevance of a crisis should be measured simply by the number of casualties caused.” Another mode of measuring calamity, Wei notes, is through Facebook Safety Check, which the social media giant controversially rolled out during the 2015 Paris attacks, despite the service's intention to serve as a check-in during natural disasters.  “Users could confirm the location of themselves and other nearby users on Facebook, informing relatives and friends of their safety, at that time,” Wei says. “My cellphone was fiercely hot, like a freshly cooked pancake, informing me that a great number of people were 'secure for now.'""  In line with Facebook's decision to expand Safety Check to include acts of terror in its definition of emergency situations, as disasters of all kinds have occurred, public opinion of safety decreases, while the need to place blame increases each time.  Check out The Creators Project's documentary on Li Wei below:   Li Wei's first European exhibition took place at the Paris Asian Art Fair, which ran October 20–23. Secure for Now was also shown at the Artissima Art Fair in Torino, Italy from November 4–6. To see more of Wei's work, click here.

"Members of Congress meeting constituents in their district this week are likely to encounter an unusual dynamic: Obamacare supporters who suddenly seem to outnumber the law’s opponents. The New York Times’s Jonathan Martin wrote this weekend about a new reality dawning on congressional Republicans: Constituents who dislike Obamacare are no longer anywhere near as vocal as they used to be, while the health law’s supporters are suddenly more energized than ever. Many have remarked on how this seems to be a mirror image of 2009, when the Tea Party became far more mobilized in opposition to Democrats’ health reform legislation than supporters were. And it’s also, of course, worth remembering that Democrats forged onward with health reform regardless of these prominent protests. But there’s also a crucially important difference between the two situations: The 2009 Democratic proposal planned to give out new benefits, while GOP proposals for Obamacare repeal today would instead put existing benefits at risk. In practice, the politics of those respective scenarios have tended to play out very differently. Yes, a new law giving people stuff — in the form of either new benefits or tax cuts — can be controversial and difficult to pass. Messing with the stuff people are already getting has tended to be exponentially more controversial, though, because it’s more actively harmful. Simply put, politicians of all stripes are more eager to go out on a limb to help their voters rather than to support something they believe will harm them. For a reminder of how this has worked, just think back to the last time Republicans had control of both the White House and Congress — from 2003 to 2006, under George W. Bush. Though GOP rhetoric has often focused on the need to cut spending, Bush had his greatest domestic legislative successes in his first term, when he focused on giving people stuff. Namely, he enacted two big rounds of tax cuts and the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. None of those victories came easy — Republicans were forced to scale back their second round of tax cuts, and the final House vote on Medicare in 2003 was famously controversial. Still, all of them ended up passing in the end. But fresh off his reelection to a second term, Bush decided to make a bold proposal to overhaul the existing Social Security program by partially privatizing it. This did not end well for him. I recapped this story at greater length in an article back in January. Overall, though the defeat of Social Security reform had many elements — administration missteps, a unified Democratic opposition, and so on — the most important one is that the proposal, at its core, was about messing with the benefits people were already getting. Politicians looked for feedback from their constituents on Bush’s plan, and what they heard was so negative that even moderate red-state Democrats temperamentally inclined toward bipartisanship, like then-Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, decided the plan was a loser. By early February, New York Times reporter Robin Toner could report on “a general anxiety attack in the Republican center over Social Security.” Eventually, all the major players became convinced it couldn’t pass, and the centerpiece of Bush’s second-term domestic agenda was never even brought to a vote. Obamacare’s situation now isn’t a perfect parallel here. It’s a much younger program than Social Security, and there’s a stronger case that the exchanges may be in some trouble and in need of an imminent overhaul. Plus, Obamacare repeal has been the centerpiece of Republican messaging for years, whereas Social Security privatization was never more than a minor issue during the 2000 and 2004 campaigns. Still, as Martin’s story suggests, this GOP base enthusiasm may have ebbed, and it’s worth keeping the fate of Social Security reform in mind.",today-in-obamacare-why-republicans-have-a-much-tougher-task-than-obama-did.txt,drew.uq
"President Donald Trump’s attempt to convince people that he’s a “stable genius” is off to a rough start. On Tuesday, Trump spontaneously invited reporters to sit in on a 55-minute meeting on immigration with congressional lawmakers from both parties. In the wake of Trump’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program by March, legislators have been scrambling to find a way to allow child immigrants who entered the U.S. without authorization — known as “Dreamers"" — to stay in the country. The only problem? Trump apparently can’t stick to his own talking points. “What about a clean DACA bill now, with a commitment that we go into a comprehensive reform procedure?” California Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked the president. A “clean DACA bill” would protect Dreamers’ ability to stay in the country, without Republican-supported provisions such as increased border enforcement or money for Trump’s wall.  “Would you be agreeable to that?” the veteran Democratic senator pressed.

Trump replied, “Yeah, I would like — I would like to do that.” That prospect immediately alarmed Republicans in the room. California Rep. Kevin McCarthy leapt in to ask Trump “to be clear though” and remind him that “we have to have security.” It also, apparently, alarmed the White House, which released a transcript of the meeting — sans Trump's comment, as the Washington Post noted.  A White House official told the Post that the oversight, which has since been corrected in the official transcript, was unintentional. According to CNN, the meeting’s stenographer missed the line because too many people were talking at once.  This is not, however, the first time a White House transcript — which reporters and historians frequently consult — has been altered. During Anthony Scaramucci’s 11-day tenure as White House communications director, he said that Trump was capable of sinking “3-foot putts.” But in the transcript, New York Magazine pointed out, Scaramucci was quoted as saying that Trump can perform “30-foot putts.”",trump-randomly-agrees-to-a-clean-daca-bill.txt,drew.uq

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday it was nonsense to think that Moscow would have poisoned former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who are critically ill in a British hospital.  Britain has said that Skripal and his daughter were poisoned by the Soviet-era ‘Novichok’ nerve agent, and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Sunday that Russia has been stockpiling it and investigating how such weapons could be used in assassinations.  But Putin, in his first detailed comments on the poisoning, said Russia had been falsely accused.  “As for the tragedy that you mentioned, I found out about it from the media. The first thing that entered my head was that if it had been a military-grade nerve agent, the people would have died on the spot,” Putin told reporters.  “Secondly, Russia does not have such (nerve) agents. We destroyed all our chemical weapons under the supervision of international  organizations, and we did it first, unlike some of our partners who promised to do it, but unfortunately did not keep their promises,” Putin said.  Despite the tensions, Putin said Moscow was ready to cooperate with London.   “... We are ready to cooperate, we said that straight away, we are ready to take part in the necessary investigations, but for that there needs be a desire from the other side, and we don’t see that yet. But we are not taking it off the agenda, joint efforts are possible.”  “As a whole, of course, I think any sensible person would understand that it would be rubbish, drivel, nonsense, for Russia to embark on such an escapade on the eve of a presidential election. It’s just unthinkable.”  Putin was speaking after winning a new term in a presidential election.   British officials have said Moscow was culpable for the poisoning and expelled 23 Russian diplomats based in London.  Moscow retaliated on Saturday by expelling the same number of British diplomats from Moscow, shuttering the British consulate in Russia’s second city of St Petersburg and closing down the Russian activities of the British Council, which promoted British culture overseas.

"(Reuters) - Wayfair Inc came under pressure on Tuesday after hundreds of employees were reported to be planning a walkout over the retailer’s alleged sale of more than $200,000 in bedroom furniture for a Texas detention facility for migrant children.  Shares of the company fell 5.3% to $144.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.  A Twitter account under the handle @wayfairwalkout, created this month with a following of more than 13,000 including high-profile Democratic U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called for the work stop on Wednesday.  Wayfair, headquartered in Boston, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The @wayfairwalkout account referred Reuters to the company and Reuters was not able to confirm it was created by Wayfair employees.  Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter: “I stand with hundreds of @Wayfair employees who are planning to stage a walkout at their Boston headquarters tomorrow. The safety and well-being of immigrant children is always worth fighting for.”  An image of a letter to Wayfair leaders from employees said that an order for more than $200,000 of bedroom furniture was destined for a facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas that would house migrant children seeking asylum.  Criticism has mounted this week over the detention of  migrant children in overcrowded, squalid conditions.  “In response to a recent letter signed by 547 employees, our CEO said that the company would not cease doing business with contractors furnishing border camps,” @wayfairwalkout  tweeted.  It demanded that Wayfair stop selling to migrant detention camps and that it give profits, which they claim amount to $86,000, to a Texas-based non-profit agency offering legal services to immigrants.  Screenshots on Twitter of a letter to employees that said it was from the retailer’s “leadership team” read, “...We believe it is our business to sell to any customer who is acting within the laws of the countries within which we operate.”  The walkout, scheduled to take place on Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. ET in Boston’s Copley Square, is the latest example of employees protesting workplace social issues.   In June 2018, Alphabet Inc’s Google faced internal upheaval over a contract to help the U.S. military analyze aerial drone imagery.   The hashtag “#wayfairwalkout” was top trending in the United State on Twitter as of Tuesday evening.   “Wayfair workers couldn’t stomach they were making beds to cage children,” tweeted Ocasio-Cortez. “They asked the company to stop.

"Medicaid expansion is back on the ballot. Organizers in Utah submitted signatures on Monday to put an initiative expanding Medicaid on the state’s ballot in November. They got 165,000 signatures, or about 50,000 more than they needed. State legislators are actually pushing a limited form of Medicaid expansion, but, as we covered before, the Trump administration seems unlikely to greenlight that proposal. The ballot initiative being submitted today would be a clean version of expansion. Medicaid expansion would cover about 150,000 low-income people in Utah, one of 18 mostly Republican-led states to refuse to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. A recent poll by the Salt Lake Tribune and the University of Utah found 62 percent of Utah voters support the ballot initiative. ”People want more health care — not less,” Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, a left-leaning economic justice group that is helping support the initiative, said in a statement. “They are done with politicians who are not addressing their top concerns, and they are taking action to do something about it.” Last year, Maine became the first state to approve Medicaid expansion by ballot initiative, though its Republican governor is doing what he can to stop it. Utah could be the next — and signatures are being gathered in several other red states to try to finally push through Medicaid expansion. Organizers are also hoping to put initiatives on the ballot in Idaho and Nebraska. It has been a slow grind to push the holdout states to expand Medicaid — some 4 million Americans have been left without insurance as a result — but this fall, voters will have a chance to make significant strides toward the nationwide expansion that the ACA originally envisioned. In Idaho, organizers have an April 30 deadline to submit about 56,000 signatures. The Fairness Project told me they “will significantly exceed that number.” Medicaid expansion would cover about 62,000 people in the Potato State; a 2017 survey found that 70 percent of Idahoans said they supported closing the state’s coverage gap, though it didn’t ask about the Medicaid expansion explicitly. (Here’s a good piece from BuzzFeed’s Anne Helen Petersen about the health care politics there.) In Nebraska, the deadline for submitting signatures for a ballot initiative is July 6; organizers said that the campaign was “on track” to gain the 85,000 signatures that they need. Medicaid expansion would cover nearly 90,000 people in the state. (The Fairness Project is also helping to support a signature drive in Montana. The state has already expanded Medicaid, but the expansion would end in 2019 unless it is reauthorized. It has covered about 90,000 people in the state.) The prize turkeys for Medicaid expansion will always be Texas and Florida, where serious ballot initiative campaigns have yet to be mounted. And, as we have seen in Maine, voters approving Medicaid expansion doesn’t mean things will go smoothly if there are intransigent state officials. Still, Medicaid notched some big wins at the polls last year — in Maine and in Virginia, where Democrats won huge victories campaigning on the issue and may soon approve expansion as a result — and it will get another shot in a few months.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp said on Tuesday it would transfer its $300 billion-a-day foreign exchange derivatives trading business to Dublin from London ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union next year.  Major electronic bond and forex trading platforms have announced plans over the past year to shift their trading businesses out of London ahead of Brexit in March 2019, with most of Thomson Reuters’ rivals opting for Amsterdam.  Thomson Reuters has applied to the Irish central bank to move its foreign exchange Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) to Dublin so that it can continue to sell into the EU’s single market, the company said in a statement.   It intends to transfer all “existing client relationships of the Thomson Reuters MTF and Dealing, as well as Fixed Income Callouts and Auctions, from RTSL to our new Irish legal entity ahead of the Brexit date.”  Neill Penney, the company’s co-head of trading, said there were no plans to move staff from London but that some new personnel would be hired in Dublin.  He said Thomson Reuters had opted for Dublin over Amsterdam because it was the most cost-effective, would “minimize disruption for clients” and because Dublin’s growing role as a center for financial technology and research would “open a number of doors” should the company want to expand.    “It doesn’t matter for our customers which European city we are in ... From a technology front, the technology is remaining where it is, which is in London and New York,” he said.  All spot forex trading, where its volumes top $100 billion a day, would remain in London, as would its post-trade services.  Thomson Reuters runs one of the world’s largest trading platforms in the $5 trillion-a-day global foreign exchange market.  Even if only the legal entity, the departure of any part of a currencies trading business will be a blow to London. Foreign exchange trading remains the crown jewel of the city’s financial services industry with volumes traded in the city far surpassing its nearest rival.   Big banks and trading platforms compete on speed when trading forex and invest heavily in cutting edge technology in London.  While trading platforms - or even some of the dealers themselves - head elsewhere after Brexit most of the hardware is likely to remain in London because of the high-speed sub-Atlantic cables linking it to New York.  Bloomberg, MarketAxess and Nex Group have chosen Amsterdam as their EU hub for their trading units, media have reported.   Bonds platform Tradeweb, in which Thomson Reuters has a stake, also announced plans to move to Amsterdam, a city that hosts many of the fast-moving algorithmic trading businesses active in FX and fixed income markets.   Thomson Reuters, controlled by Canada’s Thomson family, is the parent of Reuters News.  Its forex business is part of the trading operations being bought by private equity giant Blackstone.

Then there were the incessant buttons to click, documents to send, and other mildly irritating tasks, all as I worked towards the next promotion. The recently released game, created by Pippin Barr, is a simulation of office work using late ’90s Windows sound and visuals, set in a near future where robots have taken on the real labor. The game “poses as an application that humans who have been put out of work by robots and AI can play as a way to recapture the sense they once had of doing work and being productive,” Barr, an assistant professor in the Department of Design and Computation Arts at Concordia University in Montréal, writes in a release. “It’s a kind of semi-condescending service offered by this new world to those of us who can’t deal with it.”  It’s also a sadly accurate simulation of many offices, where attempts to get work done are constantly derailed by work motivation, whether meetings, messages, emails, or just a particularly aggravating motivational poster. Barr often experiments with game structures for unconventional play, such as his digital take on Marina Abramović’s “The Artist Is Present,” and the v r 3 museum of rendered water launched earlier this year. Players begin It is as if you were doing work as a lowly “Screen Administrator,” before progressing through meaningless tasks and some enforced “breaks” to play Breakout, and being promoted to titles like “Big Data Administrator.” You’re rewarded with perky sound effects and pop-up windows, yet the job always stays the same. The only things you can change are your desktop backdrop (a cat and a photograph of a messy desk being options) and the looping MIDI music, including a “world” selection that has a grating pan flute accompaniment. It is, needless to say, rather depressing. Alice O’Connor, who shared the game on Rock Paper Shotgun, notes that it’s not too far from reality, as there are fake companies in France run as real offices for the unemployed to get workplace training. Other games have similarly pondered the office in an automated future, including Owlchemy Lab’s VR Job Simulator (Kotaku made a list of 10 games that simulate office jobs). And Barr’s creation evokes some of the irony in games such as the Sims, where the mechanics involve mundane life actions like microwaving a ramen cup or reading a newspaper’s “help wanted” ads. Increasingly, performative office communications like Slack basically turn the workspace into a large-scale RPG, or at least add more digital noise to the desktop.

While sales following legalization on October 17 were reportedly massive in some provinces—one chain in Alberta claimed it made $1.3 million [$1 million USD] in five days—weed’s popularity is a bit of a double-edged sword due to supply issues. Several stores have already run out of stock and are having difficulty ordering more cannabis; ditto for online sales on various provincial government websites, where many products are labeled “out of stock.” Even on the medical side of things, licensed producers such as industry giant Tilray and CannTrust, are low on flower for patients. Legalization has been years in the making in Canada, so why don’t we have enough weed? Sutton told VICE part of the problem is licensed producers are largely run by people who don’t have a background in farming or cannabis. He believes publicly traded LPs have hyped up their growing ability in the media to sell stocks, and that “analysts, regulators, bankers—everyone started drinking the Kool-Aid.” But he doesn’t think LPs are anywhere close to mastering how to mass produce decent quality cannabis. “Most licensed producers still have no idea how to cultivate cannabis in a repeatable way,” he said. He noted Tantalus Labs, which operates a 75,000 square-foot-grow, took two years to design its greenhouse and another two to build it. But he says others in the industry have set up facilities within months, which he doesn’t think is enough time to ensure they are running optimally. Sutton said there are two types of master growers in the industry: Those who came over from the black market and have a deep understanding of the cannabis plant but were likely running lots of smaller grows, and master growers who come from an industrial agriculture background not specific to cannabis. “The cannabis plant presents unique challenges in that it’s very susceptible to crop loss. Tomatoes wouldn’t have the same risk profile,” he said. Sutton said cannabis is a sensitive plant that’s difficult to control without pesticides—which is what Health Canada requires. Over or under irrigating, misusing nutrients, powdery mildew, root rot, and botrytis (bud rot) are all things that can ruin the crop. The institutional knowledge needed to reliably grow massive amounts of cannabis simply doesn’t exist, he said, and the industry won’t figure it out for a while. “We will not see anything close to equitable supply relative to demand in the next 18 months,” he said. “It will result in the collapse of some of these big companies on the stock market.” Jordan Sinclair, vice president of communications for Canopy, the largest legal weed producer in the world, told VICE he disagrees with that assessment. “I don’t think it’s fair at all to say that LPs aren’t set up to do it. Maybe that person’s LP isn’t set up to do it,” he said. Sinclair told VICE there are a number of factors contributing the supply issues, including larger than anticipated demand, logistical issues in getting product onto store shelves, and yields that are still a few months away from being harvested. Canopy has more than 2.4 million square feet of growing space.  “The reality is we’ve been expanding over the last year, but some of the expansions will only be mature or producing at full capacity over the next few months,” Sinclair said, noting he thinks things will stabilize in the next month or so.  Rosalie Wyonch, an analyst with C.D. Howe Institute, a non-profit research firm, told VICE that Canada’s legal weed supply is only likely to meet 30 to 60 percent of demand for at least a year. But Wyonch said a variety of factors are at play, and “no one is completely guilty and no one is completely innocent.” Wyonch said the federal government via Health Canada may not have approved enough LP licenses in time for legalization. Though they sped up that process more recently, it may have been too little too late, she said. Based on LP’s inventories and what they’d been selling historically, it was clear there would be a shortage, Wyonch told VICE. However, “if you took the LPs at their word of what their production could be in the future, it’s a massive oversupply.” Provinces are the wholesalers of weed across Canada, and Wyonch said they are responsible for securing enough weed, which they may not have done. Quebec, in particular, only secured half of what demand would be, she said. On Friday, Quebec announced its government-run stores will only be open four days a week due to a shortage of supply. But some LPs have also failed to deliver on what they’ve agreed to supply. Sutton told VICE that issue could explain why LPs are short on medical cannabis. “If you miss your obligations to your distributor, you’re in big trouble,” he said. “The truth is there’s a huge incentive for LPs to supply distributors before they supply medical patients and as a result, these medical patients are getting the short end of the stick.” Longtime cannabis advocate Tracy Curley told VICE the supply for patients has run dry. As of Wednesday last week, she said Tilray was only offering one strain of flower.  “I took a look at eight LPs. I managed to find five strains of flower,” she said, noting some higher THC strains are being transferred from the medical supply to the rec market. While LPs can potentially make more money per gram selling to patients, Curley said strict advertising regulations mean LPs need to get their weed into provincial stores in order to gain brand recognition. Reached by VICE, Tilray, which had a market cap as high as $20 billion [$15.2 billion USD] in September but has seen its stock drop by about half since its record high, said it expects to have more flower and oil varieties available “soon.” “We have received an unusually high volume of orders on Tilray medical cannabis products this month. In anticipation of a potential stock-out of whole flower, we proactively informed patients of this temporary supply interruption which resulted in an additional high volume of orders on oil and capsule varieties, as well,” said Tilray spokeswoman Chrissy Roebuck.  CannTrust, which was also out of flower for medical patients as of Friday, told VICE it is “working hard to fix this urgently” and had increased the number of third-party testing labs it works with in order to restock more quickly. Wyonch told VICE the supply shortage amounts to part of the growing pains of legalization. In the meantime, she said it will take years to eliminate the black market—one of the primary goals the government has cited for legalization cannabis.  “LPs basically need to grow as much weed as possible,” and the government shouldn’t stand in their way, she said.

"Unfortunately for Canadians, the evidence just keeps piling up that compared to the rest of the world, they’re getting a raw deal on data.  Canadians have some of the lowest mobile data usage in the world, and the slowest uptake for data usage—but telecoms in the country make the highest profits for data plans, according to a new report.  Telecom analysis firm Tefficient looked at data usage per SIM card (i.e., per individual phone) across 36 countries in 2017 and found that people in just five countries use less data than Canadians: Greece, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, and the Czech Republic. Canadians on average used just 1.3 GB of mobile data per month in 2017. Even worse, data usage in Canada grew just six percent last year—the lowest rate of growth in the world, according to Tefficient’s report. US operators also extract a high rate of profit per gigabyte used, but less than Canadian telecoms, according to the report. Americans also used more data per month: 3.3 GB on average. Countries where telecoms made less revenue per gigabyte of mobile data had more mobile data usage and higher uptake—telecoms in India, for example, made the lowest revenue per gigabyte and the country had a 300 percent growth in data usage last year. According to Tefficient, telecoms in Canada make 35 times more profit on data than Indian telecoms.  A winning strategy for telecoms is to be more generous with data plans and accept a mid-range of revenue per gigabyte of data used, the report suggests. But that’s unlikely to happen. Canada’s telecom industry is notoriously moribund, with just three established players making up a kind of oligopoly that account for the vast majority of mobile subscriptions in the country—Rogers, Bell Canada, and Telus. It’s one of Canada’s many curious ironies that a company headquartered in Toronto runs a successful affordable mobile phone service in the US—Ting by Tucows—but has thus far been unable to operate in its home country.  When reached for comment, spokespeople for Rogers and Bell Canada directed Motherboard to the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Organization.  ""The report make comparisons using data from different sources that use different methodologies,"" said a CTWO spokesperson. ""This calls into question its conclusions, which appear to understate data usage and overstate revenues per GB in Canada, but it is also important to note when speaking about revenues, according to the OECD, Canada leads among all G7 countries in investment as a percentage of revenue and is the fourth highest among all OECD nations.""  Spokespeople for Telus were not immediately available. It’s this lack of choice, and the high prices Canadians pay for data, that makes hating on telecoms a third national sport behind hockey and lacrosse.

"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey promised on Friday that the company would soon implement sweeping changes to better protect users from abuse and harassment. We now know what some of those changes are. In an email sent to Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council, the company outlined a few policy updates that will be “rolling out in the weeks ahead.” Among them: A tougher stance on “non-consensual nudity,” or images or videos shared without the subject’s permission. Twitter has issued a broader definition of “non-consensual nudity” — it now includes “upskirt imagery, “creep shots” and hidden camera content” — plus harsher penalties for those who share this content. Instead of a temporary account suspension, first-time offenders will be permanently suspended. Twitter is also making it easier for people to report what it calls “unwanted sexual advances.” Previously, an unwanted sexual advance had to be reported by users directly involved in the situation. Soon, Twitter bystanders will also be able to report this kind of behavior. There are still a lot of other issues Twitter needs to work out. Under categories like “hate symbols,” “violent groups” and “tweets that glorify violence,” Twitter just includes a simple sentence: “More details to come.” Twitter has been dealing with abuse on its platform for years. Many believe that it’s the company’s biggest issue. Dorsey’s pledge to revamp Twitter’s user guidelines came after some users boycotted Twitter for suspending actress Rose McGowan, who was speaking out against film producer and alleged sexual predator Harvey Weinstein. “Today we saw voices silencing themselves and voices speaking out because we’re *still* not doing enough,” Dorsey tweeted. “We decided to take a more aggressive stance in our rules and how we enforce them.” A Twitter rep said the company plans to unveil more details about the updated guidelines soon. The changes outlined in the email are not final and could still change, but Twitter is clearly cracking down. Here’s the email in full. It was first reported by Wired. Dear Trust & Safety Council members, I’d like to follow up on Jack’s Friday night Tweetstorm about upcoming policy and enforcement changes. Some of these have already been discussed with you via previous conversations about the Twitter Rules update. Others are the result of internal conversations that we had throughout last week. Here’s some more information about the policies Jack mentioned as well as a few other updates that we’ll be rolling out in the weeks ahead. Non-consensual nudity Current approach * We treat people who are the original, malicious posters of non-consensual nudity the same as we do people who may unknowingly Tweet the content. In both instances, people are required to delete the Tweet(s) in question and are temporarily locked out of their accounts. They are permanently suspended if they post non-consensual nudity again. Updated approach * We will immediately and permanently suspend any account we identify as the original poster/source of non-consensual nudity and/or if a user makes it clear they are intentionally posting said content to harass their target. * We will do a full account review whenever we receive a Tweet-level report about non-consensual nudity. If the account appears to be dedicated to posting non-consensual nudity then we will suspend the entire account immediately. * Our definition of “non-consensual nudity” is expanding to more broadly include content like upskirt imagery, “creep shots,” and hidden camera content. Given that people appearing in this content often do not know the material exists, we will not require a report from a target in order to remove it. While we recognize there’s an entire genre of pornography dedicated to this type of content, it’s nearly impossible for us to distinguish when this content may/may not have been produced and distributed consensually. We would rather error on the side of protecting victims and removing this type of content when we become aware of it. Unwanted sexual advances Current approach * Pornographic content is generally permitted on Twitter, and it’s challenging to know whether or not sexually charged conversations and/or the exchange of sexual media may be wanted. To help infer whether or not a conversation is consensual, we currently rely on and take enforcement action only if/when we receive a report from a participant in the conversation. Updated approach * We are going to update the Twitter Rules to make it clear that this type of behavior is unacceptable. We will continue taking enforcement action when we receive a report from someone directly involved in the conversation. Once our improvements to bystander reporting go live, we will also leverage past interaction signals (eg things like block, mute, etc) to help determine whether something may be unwanted and action the content accordingly. Hate symbols and imagery (new) * We are still defining the exact scope of what will be covered by this policy. At a high level, hateful imagery, hate symbols, etc will now be considered sensitive media (similar to how we handle and enforce adult content and graphic violence). * More details to come. Violent groups (new) * We are still defining the exact scope of what will be covered by this policy. At a high level, we will take enforcement action against organizations that use/have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause. * More details to come here as well (including insight into the factors we will consider to identify such groups). Tweets that glorify violence (new) * We already take enforcement action against direct violent threats (“I’m going to kill you”), vague violent threats (“Someone should kill you”) and wishes/hopes of serious physical harm, death, or disease (“I hope someone kills you”). Moving forward, we will also take action against content that glorifies (“Praise be to <terrorist name> for shooting up <event>. He’s a hero!”) and/or condones (“Murdering <x group of people> makes sense. That way they won’t be a drain on social services”). * More details to come. We realize that a more aggressive policy and enforcement approach will result in the removal of more content from our service. We are comfortable making this decision, assuming that we will only be removing abusive content that violates our Rules. To help ensure this is the case, our product and operational teams will be investing heavily in improving our appeals process and turnaround times for their reviews. In addition to launching new policies, updating enforcement processes and improving our appeals process, we have to do a better job explaining our policies and setting expectations for acceptable behavior on our service. In the coming weeks, we will be: * updating the Twitter Rules as we previously discussed (+ adding in these new policies) * updating the Twitter media policy to explain what we consider to be adult content, graphic violence, and hate symbols. * launching a standalone Help Center page to explain the factors we consider when making enforcement decisions and describe our range of enforcement options * launching new policy-specific Help Center pages to describe each policy in greater detail, provide examples of what crosses the line, and set expectations for enforcement consequences * Updating outbound language to people who violate our policies (what we say when accounts are locked, suspended, appealed, etc). We have a lot of work ahead of us and will definitely be turning to you all for guidance in the weeks ahead. We will do our best to keep you looped in on our progress. All the best, Head of Safety Policy This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",twitters-new-user-rules-crack-down-on-nudity-and-unwanted-sexual-advances.txt,drew.uq
"Donald Trump won the Illinois primary last night. But he didn't get as many delegates as he could have — and it might be because his supporters were averse to voting for people with the last names Sadiq and Fakroddin. Raja Sadiq and Nabi Fakroddin both ran as delegates for Trump in Trump-friendly districts. And because of Illinois's strange voting rules, both their names were on the ballot as well as Trump's. But while Trump carried both districts Tuesday, both Sadiq and Fakroddin got many fewer votes than other delegates (with European-sounding names) running under the Trump banner. And in Fakroddin's case, at least, it kept him — and the Trump campaign — from winning a delegate slot. We don't know the exact reason for Sadiq and Fakroddin's underperformance, which was first noticed by elections analyst Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. And it's unlikely to alter the fate of the 2016 election — it looks like it only swayed the result in one race, keeping Fakroddin from winning a slot at the convention alongside the other two Trump delegates in his district. But if it's true that Trump voters allowed anti-Muslim sentiment to override their loyalty to the candidate, that's a bad sign for the Trump campaign — a sign that it still might not understand or be able to control the Islamophobia it's unleashed. To understand how this happened, you need to understand how the Illinois GOP primaries work. In most primaries, voters vote directly for a candidate. Then if the candidate receives enough votes, delegates who are pledged to that candidate are selected to go to the party convention. In Illinois, it's a little different. Fewer than a quarter of the state's delegates are assigned to whichever candidate gets the most statewide votes. For the rest, voters vote directly for delegates themselves. Each presidential campaign runs a slate of delegates pledged to that candidate in each congressional district. Each delegate is listed on the ballot alongside the name of the candidate he or she is pledged to, and voters pick a certain number of delegates from each district (usually three). So a voter yesterday who liked both Donald Trump and John Kasich could vote for two of Trump's delegates and one of Kasich's. As it turns out, plenty of congressional districts split their delegates. According to the Green Papers, Trump swept the delegate slots in nine districts (out of 18), and Ted Cruz and Kasich each swept 1. But in the other seven districts, voters selected two delegates from one campaign and one delegate from another. So split-ticket voting isn't that unusual. But there's still reason to believe something weird happened with the two Trump delegates with ""Muslim-sounding"" names. Here's why. Nabi Fakroddin has some history in Illinois state politics. He was appointed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner to the Illinois Human Rights Commission; he was also on the Regional Transit Authority but had to resign rather than serving on both commissions at once. He ran as a Trump delegate in Illinois's sixth congressional district, in the western suburbs of Chicago. But he only got about five votes for every six that the other two Trump-pledged delegates received. And that was enough to cost him the third delegate slot in the district: In the 13th congressional district, which includes Champaign, the split is a little less clear. Only one of Trump's delegates cracked the top three there; neither Raja Sadiq, who's a family physician and longtime Republican donor, nor fellow Trump delegate Toni Gauen made the cut. But the gap between Gauen, in fifth place, and Sadiq in sixth was as big as the gap between the first-place Trump delegate and Gauen. Sadiq only got 85 percent of the vote total Gauen got, and only 75 percent of the votes that leading Trump delegate Doug Hartmann got. We genuinely do not know why Sadiq and Fakroddin got fewer votes than their fellow Trump delegates. The only evidence we have that they were discriminated against because of their names is, well, the names themselves — and the vote totals. But in a primary where two-thirds of Republican voters said that Muslims should be banned from entering the US — a policy position first advanced by Donald Trump — Islamophobia is definitely running high. And there is at least a possibility that the fears of Muslims that Trump's campaign has helped stoke are powerful enough, at least in some fraction of Trump supporters, that even seeing the name ""Trump"" next to a name that sounds foreign isn't enough to win those voters' support.",trump-delegates-in-illinois-with-muslimsounding-names-didnt-do-as-well-as-white-ones.txt,drew.uq

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s three leading presidential candidates have not declared a single peso in direct private financial contributions to their election campaigns, federal records show, raising concerns from corruption watchdogs about the potential influence of dark money in a pivotal contest.  Candidates from Mexico’s three main political parties said they have relied almost exclusively on money from their parties, which is overwhelmingly public, to bankroll their campaigns, a total of more than 634 million pesos ($32.1 million).   That is according to the most recent declarations they have filed with the National Electoral Institute, known as INE.  Mexicans head to the polls on July 1 to elect their next president in what has been a highly anticipated and hard-fought contest. According to the candidates’ filings, not one of the country’s nearly 90 million registered voters made a monetary contribution directly to their campaigns, and just 70 people have given a total of around 1.4 million pesos ($70,897) of in-kind goods or services.  By law, Mexican parties must rely on public funding for the majority of their financing. Private donations are tightly regulated and have never played an important role in modern campaigns – at least not the modest sums typically declared to federal election authorities. In reality, large, clandestine contributions and illegal vote buying have factored into Mexican elections for decades, corruption watchdogs say.  The latest figures reported to INE strain credibility and underscore the difficulty of cleaning up Mexico’s campaign finance system, said Max Kaiser, an authority on anti-graft initiatives at the nonprofit Mexican Institute for Competitiveness.  “Until we stop this cycle, we won’t be able to control corruption in Mexico,” Kaiser said.  The presidential campaigns of Jose Antonio Meade, candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, and Ricardo Anaya of the National Action Party or PAN, both said their public funding was sufficient, so they did not need private money. Representatives for the two candidates said there has been no under-reporting of private donations or campaign spending.  A representative for the frontrunner, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, running for the MORENA Party, did not respond to a request for comment.  (Meet Mexico's 2018 presidential candidates: tmsnrt.rs/2MVhfjA)  The federal election agency INE regulates campaign finance. INE board member Ciro Murayama said he found nothing unusual in the candidates’ declarations that they have not taken any private money.  “If someone doesn’t believe it, they have to demonstrate it,” Murayama said in an interview. “If someone thinks something, the burden of proof is on that person.”  But Luis Carlos Ugalde, a former president of INE, acknowledged that Mexico’s strict limits on private donations are easily evaded by contributors seeking influence.  “The campaign (spending) limits are not respected” Ugalde said. “Private donors prefer to give without reporting it to buy access.”  In Mexico’s 2012 federal elections, less than three percent of campaign financing came from private donors, according to a document on INE’s website.  In the current election cycle, presidential candidates affiliated with parties are allowed to spend up to 429.6 million pesos ($21.8 million) during the campaign.  The government tightened campaign finance laws in 2007 following a contentious presidential race. A 2014 reform aimed to improve transparency and toughen penalties, including giving an electoral tribunal authority to annul the results of an election if the winner was found to have spent beyond the limits.   Still, doubts abound over the agency’s capacity to monitor illegal money. For every one peso declared in campaign spending, at least 15 pesos more go unreported, nonprofit Mexicanos Contra la Corruption estimated earlier this year.  In a poll released this week, more than a third of Mexicans surveyed said political parties had tried to buy their votes for a 2018 election, whether federal or local, according to the nonprofit Citizen’s Action Front Against Poverty.  A businessman linked to a massive corruption scandal involving Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht SA testified in 2016 to Brazilian prosecutors that the construction giant had channeled millions of dollars to a senior campaign official of Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico’s current president and a member of the PRI. Pena Nieto has repeatedly denied the allegations. Under Mexican law he is limited to a single, six-year term.   Mexico’s Attorney General said in 2017 that it would investigate the allegations. The probe is ongoing.  INE recently sanctioned an independent presidential candidate, Jaime Rodriguez, for financing irregularities. Rodriguez, who was fined 739,000 pesos ($37,423), denied wrongdoing and said the fine was unjust. He has raised 8.1 million pesos ($410,984) for his campaign, all through private contributions.  Marco Fernandez, a professor at the government school at the Tec de Monterrey university, said INE’s action showed it was becoming more sophisticated at rooting out campaign finance violations. But he said the generally small fines and lack of consequences for candidates with parties or their donors were not much of a deterrent.  “Unfortunately, so far, electoral lies are still very cheap,” Fernandez said.  (This version of the story corrects paragraph 17 to clarify that an electoral tribunal, not INE, has the power to annul elections.)

"Islamic State is attempting to destroy the Yazidi population in Syria and Iraq through killings, sexual slavery, and other crimes, acts that United Nations investigators say amount to the crime of genocide being committed by the militants against the ethno-religious group of 400,000 people. The genocide accusations were made in a UN report released on Thursday based on interviews with dozens of survivors. The report found that the Islamist militants had been systematically capturing Yazidis in Iraq and Syria since August 2014, seeking to ""erase their identity"" in a campaign that met the definition of the crime as defined under the 1948 Genocide Convention. ""The genocide of the Yazidis is ongoing,"" the report said. Commission member Vitit Muntarbhorn said they had obtained ""detailed information on places, violations and names of the perpetrators,"" and had begun sharing information with some national authorities who are prosecuting foreign fighters. Speaking at a news briefing on Thursday, Paulo Pinheiro, the chairman of the commission of inquiry called for more action.

""The crime of genocide must trigger much more assertive action at the political level, including at the Security Council,"" Pinheiro said. The four independent commissioners behind the investigation also urged major powers to rescue at least 3,200 women and children still held by Islamic State (ISIS) and to refer the case to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for prosecution. ""ISIS made no secret of its intent to destroy the Yazidis of Sinjar, and that is one of the elements that allowed us to conclude their actions amount to genocide,"" said another investigator, Carla del Ponte. ""Of course, we regard that as a road map for prosecution, for future prosecution."" The Yazidis are a religious sect whose beliefs combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions. Islamic State, which aims to set up a theocratic caliphate in Syria and Iraq based on a radical interpretation of Sunni Islam, systematically killed, captured or enslaved thousands of Yazidis when it overran the town of Sinjar in northern Iraq in August 2014. Several mass graves have since been uncovered. The militant group tried to erase the Yazidis' identity by forcing men to choose between conversion to Islam and death, raping girls as young as nine, selling women at slave markets, and drafting boys to fight, the report said. ""No other religious group present in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq has been subjected to the destruction that the Yazidis have suffered,"" the report said. ""The scale of atrocities committed, their general nature, and the fact of deliberately and systematically targeting victims on account of their membership in a particular group, while excluding members of other groups, were other factors from which the Commission was able to infer genocidal intent.""

"In 2008, a relatively unknown young U.S. senator running for president fundamentally changed political campaigns in this country. Barack Obama’s election in 2008, as the first social media president, marked the moment at which political campaigning began the significant shift from the television to the digital age. Social media platforms have since become the modern-day soapbox, providing new channels through which candidates and parties engage with voters. For evidence of the digital revolution, just follow the money. In the 2012 election cycle, political campaigns spent $159 million on digital media. In 2016, that figure is expected to top $1 billion. However, campaigns still largely use social media like they use television — by talking to the voters rather than with them. The 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia will change that in a way that should make every party, candidate and campaign manager sit up and take notice. Barack Obama’s election in 2008, as the first social media president, marked the moment at which political campaigning began the significant shift from the television to the digital age. This year, the Democratic National Convention will bring supporters into the conversation and tell the story of this historic event through the eyes of the attendees. Understanding that communication in this digital age is becoming increasingly visual, the convention will take the images captured by attendees and connect those images to other relevant information that supporters may be on the lookout for. Layering in this information and making all of these images ""intelligent"" will transform each image into an opportunity to engage supporters beyond the convention hall and lead them to information and action like never before. What’s more, the convention will track the performance of each image, and use that data to guide decisions about messaging. To do this, the convention will partner with Curalate, a marketing technology company that works with leading brands, as the convention understands the power this technology can provide to its platform and audience. The most innovative consumer brands in the world understand that discovery of their products increasingly happens visually through images and videos. The same is becoming true of how voters consume information about political parties and campaigns as visual platforms begin to dominate social media. While it’s highly likely that the dominant digital platform in the 2020 presidential election is still in the wireframing stage, you can bet that it will be based on visual content. Instagram didn’t even exist when President Obama took office — now it has half a billion users, up more than 600 percent since 2012. Snapchat currently boasts 150 million daily users and 10 billion videos viewed every day. And while it’s highly likely that the dominant digital platform in the 2020 presidential election is still in the wireframing stage, you can bet that it’ll be based on visual content. In 2016, voters will discover information about candidates and parties online through imagery to a greater extent than ever before. By using the latest technology and data available to consumer brands, the Democratic National Convention will be the most digitally engaged political event in history, and will demonstrate its commitment to innovation and to creating more compelling experiences for supporters. By taking full advantage of technology partners like Curalate, the convention will reach more people with more compelling, relevant content, and will transform a fleeting moment of discovery — when a person sees an image — into an opportunity, offering them more information and engaging them, welcoming them to join the whole country in the biggest conversation of the year. Andrew Binns is the chief innovation officer of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, which will be held July 25-28 in Philadelphia. Reach him @binns. Apu Gupta is the co-founder and CEO of Curalate, a leading marketing technology company and official technology provider to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Reach him @apugupta.

"Michael Flynn’s plea deal with prosecutors in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe is a watershed moment for President Donald Trump — one that leaves him with two choices, each with clear risks. Flynn, who was Trump’s national security adviser for 24 days and was also a top campaign adviser, has admitted to lying to the FBI about two of his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December 2016. But here’s the kicker: Flynn told investigators that “a very senior member” of Trump’s presidential transition team told him to make contact with Russian government officials — in other words, he’s now claiming he was just following orders when he went to talk to the Russians. Which means that Flynn’s plea deal and cooperation with the Mueller investigation could potentially implicate senior members of Trump’s inner circle, or even the president himself, in at the very least some questionable behavior. Indeed, reports have suggested that Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner may have been one of the senior officials of the transition team who directed Flynn to speak to the Russians. So at this point, Trump has two options for how to respond to all of this: try to make it all go away, or just try to minimize the potential damage. In other words: betray Flynn or fire Mueller. Betraying Flynn seems like the better option, even though it will lead to weeks of reports about the hypocrisy and outright lies of the Trump administration. But that seems far more preferable — and less risky — to firing Mueller, which could spark a massive political and constitutional crisis. Trump could try to downplay the significance of Flynn’s plea deal, saying that it still doesn’t implicate him or other members of his campaign. He could also try to downplay Flynn’s role in his campaign, making it seem like Flynn wasn’t an important figure during the election and that any interactions he had with Russians wouldn’t have come from the top. Early indications suggest that this may be the strategy the president’s lawyers are pursuing. Top White House lawyer Ty Cobb said in a statement shortly after the announcement of the plea deal that “[n]othing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn.” That may be true for now. But the fact that Flynn is cooperating with the investigation means he could potentially give Mueller’s team information that does implicate other people in the Trump orbit. And trying to downplay Flynn’s involvement in the campaign would be a hard sell. Flynn, a former three-star general and Obama administration intelligence official, joined the campaign in February 2016 and immediately became a prominent campaign surrogate, offering Trump some credibility on foreign policy and national security affairs — two areas where Trump had no prior experience. He led chants of “Lock her up!” during the Republican National Convention on July 18, 2016, referring to Hillary Clinton and the probe into her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. And on November 17, 2016, just nine days after the election, Trump named Flynn as his national security adviser. That made Flynn one of the most powerful people in Washington, with responsibilities for overseeing and coordinating America’s wars, intelligence gathering, and diplomacy. (Flynn resigned in February after lying to Vice President Mike Pence about the content of his conversations with Kislyak in December — the same conversations Flynn now admits to having lied to the FBI about in January.) Even once Flynn was gone, Trump still went to bat for him — going as far as asking then-FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn entirely. An assertion that Flynn wasn’t an important figure in the Trump inner circle would beggar belief. To be fair, Trump has no problem lying in general — especially to the press — and he’s no stranger to negative press coverage and shouts of hypocrisy. So throwing Flynn under the bus may actually be the safer option for him. But there’s a bleaker choice for Trump — firing Mueller — which could lead to a lot more trouble. The second option would be to fire Mueller in an attempt to end the probe altogether and prevent Mueller from using Flynn’s cooperation to build a case against the president, his family, or other top aides. Trump has mused about firing Mueller before, but held off, in part because senior lawmakers from both parties have warned him of serious and immediate consequences if he chose to do so. To many establishment Republicans, the prospect that Trump would fire Mueller is unimaginable. “I cannot possibly imagine the president terminating Bob Mueller,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) said in June. “It just cannot happen.” But now that Flynn is cooperating with the special counsel, Trump might decide it’s worth the risk to let Mueller go — which could lead to outcries on Capitol Hill, even from Republicans. There’s another potential problem for Trump, though: Getting rid of Mueller might not actually be as easy as it sounds. That’s because Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told Congress back in June that he interpreted the special counsel regulation to mean that he (Rosenstein) is the only person in government with the authority to fire Mueller — not the president. And he said that he would only fire Mueller for “good cause,” and would refuse to carry out an order from the president to fire Mueller if good cause were not established. It’s doubtful that Rosenstein would consider Trump not wanting himself, his family, or his close aides to potentially be indicted on criminal charges to be “good cause,” and would thus refuse to fire Mueller. Which means Trump would have to fire Rosenstein — and perhaps several more Justice Department officials — until he found one willing to carry out his order. That could get very, very messy — and potentially provoke a constitutional crisis. Here’s why: Throughout the entire process, Trump would purposely be trying to kill an investigation that could charge him, his family members, or his close associates with crimes. That would mean he was putting his personal interests above the law — and no president is above the law. It would be a blatant attempt at a cover-up. Senators on both sides of the aisle, including Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-DE), have proposed a bill to protect Mueller and avoid such a scenario. Explaining his proposed bill, Tillis told CNN in August, ""The President would maintain the power to remove the special counsel, but we would just want to make sure that it had merit and have that back-end judicial process.” “And if there is a termination, we just want to make sure, through judicial review, that it was warranted,” he added. Congress has yet to pass that bill, though, which means that Trump could still fire Mueller and potentially provoke a showdown with the Justice Department. That’s why Coons seems adamant that he will continue to push his bill. “It’s now more important than ever that Special Counsel Mueller is able to continue his investigation without interference, and I am continuing to work on bipartisan legislation to protect the special counsel from being fired without cause,” Coons said in a statement on Friday.",michael-flynns-plea-deal-leaves-trump-with-two-bleak-options.txt,drew.uq
"This article originally appeared on VICE Sports Canada. The NHL's polarizing decision to skip out on the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea on Monday has been met with disappointment and anger by many players across the league, including some of its biggest stars. In a statement released by the league's owners, with commissioner Gary Bettman calling the matter ""officially closed"" on Tuesday, the NHL essentially directed most of the blame toward the IOC and NHLPA for not offering concessions that would make it worthwhile for the league to shut down for 17 days in the middle of its season next February. In response, the Players Association released a statement of its own on Monday night, leading off with a line that read, ""The players are extraordinarily disappointed and adamantly disagree with the NHL's shortsighted decision to not continue our participation in the Olympics."" Here's the rest of the statement: Any sort of inconvenience the Olympics may cause to next season's schedule is a small price to pay compared to the opportunity to showcase our game and our greatest players on this enormous international stage.  A unique opportunity lies ahead with the 2018 and 2022 Olympics in Asia. The NHL may believe it is penalizing the IOC or the players, or both, for not giving the owners some meaningful concessions in order to induce them to agree to go to PyeongChang. Instead this impedes the growth of our great game by walking away from an opportunity to reach sports fans worldwide. Moreover, it is doing so after the financial issues relating to insurance and transportation have been resolved with the IOC and IIHF. The League's efforts to blame others for its decision is as unfortunate as the decision itself. NHL players are patriotic and they do not take this lightly. A decent respect for the opinions of the players matters. This is the NHL's decision, and its alone. It is very unfortunate for the game, the players and millions of loyal hockey fans. Aside from the collective message from the NHLPA to the league, many coaches and players around the NHL commented individually on their disappointment in the NHL's decision to skip the premier international sporting event in the world during a time when the game is desperate to grow across the pond. Toronto Maple Leafs head coach Mike Babcock, who was Canada's bench boss for its last two consecutive Olympic gold medals in 2010 and 2014, said, ''I'm just going to tell you I'm disappointed.'' Future Hall of Fame goaltenders Carey Price, who backstopped Canada to a gold medal in 2014, and Henrik Lundqvist, who led Sweden to a gold in 2006, each chimed in to voice their disappointment with the league's choice to forgo the 2018 Games. ''It's beyond disappointing. It was one of the best experiences of my life and catapulted my career to the next level and things have been going pretty well since then,'' said Price. ""I feel like we're short changing some of the younger players that haven't had that opportunity."" Lundqvist, meanwhile, took to Twitter to voice his displeasure about the decision. Disappointing news, — Henrik Lundqvist (@HLundqvist30)April 3, 2017 Lundqvist's Swedish teammate, Henrik Zetterberg, commented on the matter in a postgame scrum after Monday's contest against Ottawa. ""I haven't really seen the statement yet, but I'm not real surprised. They probably want something from us, as always,"" said Zetterberg. — Marc-Édouard Vlasic (@Vlasic44)April 3, 2017 Star Senators defenceman Erik Karlsson came swinging, too. .— Craig Custance (@CraigCustance)April 4, 2017 Team Canada and San Jose Sharks defenceman Marc-Edouard Vlasic simply tweeted out a cryptic photo (see above) of the OIympic rings right after the NHL's announcement, while eight-year NHL veteran Brandon Prust, who is now playing in the DEL in Germany, took a more direct approach and went right at the commissioner with his always-honest opinion.

"This post is part of Mischiefs of Faction, an independent political science blog featuring reflections on the party system. In the immediate wake of Justice Scalia's death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell very quickly announced that President Obama should not name Scalia's successor. A great deal of attention has been paid (including by the Onion) to the political posturing that has taken place in the hours and days since. Understandably, much of it focuses on what kind of nominee might actually be nominated and whether such a nominee would actually be confirmed. We're going to take a different tack and consider why McConnell so quickly tried to preempt a nominee in the first place. Formally, it is very easy for McConnell and his Republican colleagues to ensure that no Obama nominee would be confirmed (though the Democrats could make life difficult). Given this, then standard ""gatekeeping'' logic (see here) implies that the GOP can only gain from at least seeing whom Obama would nominate: If Obama nominates an unacceptable nominee, the GOP senators can simply say no to whomever Obama nominates. Furthermore, withstanding the pressure to vote on an Obama nominee could help GOP incumbents signal their commitment to the conservative principles, such as gun rights, that Scalia stood for on the Court. This logic is laid out by one of us in ""Signaling Through Obstruction"" (ungated version). However, from a strategic standpoint, McConnell might fear that 14 or more of his colleagues would not be willing to obstruct a moderate and well-qualified nominee. In fact, some senators might actually be willing to vote for a relatively liberal nominee because they fear being perceived as too conservative by moderate voters. This logic lies at the heart of the reaction described by Tim Groseclose and Nolan McCarty. The possibility of incumbents fearing the blame game is unusually important for McConnell this year because the GOP has 24 Senate incumbents up for reelection this year, and of the 12 competitive Senate races this year, 10 are for seats currently held by Republicans. Naturally, most of those competitive seats are in states where the electorate is relatively more moderate — places like Illinois (Mark Kirk), Missouri (Roy Blunt), North Carolina (Richard Burr), New Hampshire (Kelly Ayotte), and Ohio (Rob Portman). Such incumbents might worry that obstruction would be too costly in terms of alienating independent voters in the general election. Indeed, see Kirk's op-ed from Monday, in which he wrote: I recognize the right of the president, be it Republican or Democrat, to place before the Senate a nominee for the Supreme Court and I fully expect and look forward to President Barack Obama advancing a nominee for the Senate to consider. Putting the ""Signaling Through Obstruction"" and ""Blame Game"" logics together creates a rich set of scenarios for McConnell, who is undoubtedly uncertain not only about how the electoral environments facing his 24 colleagues will unfold, but also about how these colleagues will behave as the election progresses. Accordingly, he may have a strong incentive to avoid forcing his colleagues to go ""on the record"" with either a vote on a Supreme Court nominee, or with being seen as complicit in obstructing one, particularly one who will likely be widely perceived as extremely qualified and politically moderate. After all, if there is no nominee to vote for or obstruct, voters cannot infer much, if anything, about their incumbents' stances from their actions. As has been well documented by political science research (see here and here for examples), senators are sensitive to opinion among their political base when voting on Supreme Court nominees. At the same time, well-qualified, moderate nominees tend to be broadly politically popular. In other words, the problem for McConnell is that if President Obama selects a well-qualified, politically moderate nominee, Republicans will have to decide whether to go on the record voting against the nominee, revealing themselves to be ideological extremists, or to support a political moderate, nominated by President Obama, potentially upsetting their political bases. In the context of a competitive election, the choice is then between the base and independents, both of which are necessary to win reelection in closely divided states. In line with all of this, and as one of us has pointed out in another post, there may be a strong interest among Democrats in keeping the nomination debate going as part of the election, whereas Republicans might have a distinct interest in ending the discussion (or at least hiding it from public discussion until after the election). Many have speculated that McConnell's reluctance is due to his hope that a future Republican president might nominate Justice Scalia's replacement. However, our logic suggests a different rationale. Given President Obama's relatively constrained political capital and the GOP's control of the Senate, this seems like a good opportunity for the Republicans to press Obama for a moderate nominee. However, that might be exactly what McConnell fears! McConnell's desire to preempt any Obama nominee is motivated by the fear that, when confronted by a nominee, his GOP colleagues will confront a Catch-22 in which, regardless of what they say or do, the GOP's prospects for maintaining control of the Senate in 2017 will be worsened. Scalia's passing rocked the political scene, and left Mitch McConnell in a very hard place indeed.",the-game-theory-behind-mitch-mcconnells-supreme-court-strategy.txt,drew.uq
"CARACAS (Reuters) - Citibank and Deutsche Bank have taken control of around $1.4 billion of Venezuelan government gold, which they received as guarantees for loans, as a result of U.S. sanctions on the Venezuelan Central Bank, according to five sources.  Between 2014 and 2016 the central bank (BCV) used a portion of its foreign gold reserves to guarantee financial operations with banks to boost liquidity, with the intention of repaying the loans to avoid losing the gold.  Five sources with knowledge of the deals said the BCV had agreed with Citibank and Deutsche Bank to buy back the gold in 2020 and 2021, but since the U.S. government imposed sanctions on the BCV in April the banks had invoked a condition of the contracts to retain ownership of the bars.  Both banks had resolved that an “event of default” had occurred due to the sanctions, as established in agreements underpinning the gold swap deals, the sources said.  Citibank took control of gold for around $400 million BCV was supposed to repay in 2020. For a separate guarantee Deutsch Bank took $1 billion, the sources said.  Citibank and Deutsche Bank declined to comment, and the BCV did not respond to a request to comment.  Reuters has not been able to review the gold swap contracts the BCV signed with the banks and it is not clear if the central bank could initiate legal proceedings to seek to regain control of the gold.  Since 2017, the BCV has partially recovered some gold bars it used to guarantee the loans, at the same time as it began to sell dozens of tonnes of gold to Turkey and other Middle Eastern allies to earn vital foreign currency, according to the sources and official data.  The BCV in 2018 had paid $172 million to Citibank to recover part of the gold it had put up as guarantee in a swap operation.  In March of this year, the BCV was unable to pay $1.1 billion to Citibank via a repurchase agreement to recover part of the gold it gave to Citibank for a $1.6 billion loan, sources told Reuters at the time. The BCV was supposed to pay another $400 million in 2020 to Citibank under the agreement, but Citibank has now taken the gold instead.   Both banks can now sell the Venezuelan gold to recover the value of the loans, and any money left over would be returned to Venezuela, the sources said. But under U.S. sanctions banks are restricted from carrying out any transactions with the BCV.  Opposition leader Juan Guaido’s team has approached Citibank and Deutsche Bank to ask the banks to deposit a portion of the gold in accounts that President Nicolas Maduro’s government can not access, three sources said.  Guaido, head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency, denouncing Maduro as illegitimate after he secured re-election last year in a vote widely considered fraudulent.  Most Western nations recognize Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader, while Maduro calls Guaido a coup-mongering U.S. puppet.

" Six people were arrested Sunday over an apparent assassination attempt on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro using explosive-laden drones.   Analysts warn the arrests are likely to be just the start of a brutal crackdown in response to the embarrassing security breach.  The socialist leader, who is presiding over an escalating economic and humanitarian crisis, was giving a speech at a military event in the capital Caracas Saturday evening when two DJI M600 drones, each carrying a kilogram of C-4 explosive, flew near his podium. The military knocked one drone off-course electronically, and the other crashed into a nearby apartment building, Interior Minister Nestor Luis Reverol said Sunday, describing it as a terrorist attack.  Pandemonium broke out as the devices exploded, with bodyguards scrambling to cover Maduro with shields. Hundreds of soldiers gathered for the event ran for cover.  Maduro’s government has blamed the attack on an international plot involving local militants, supported by Colombia’s outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos, and dissident networks based in Miami. Reverol said one of the six arrested had an outstanding warrant for an alleged role in an August 2017 attack on a military base in Valencia. Another had been previously arrested during anti-government protests in 2014.

Reverol said one of the six arrested had an outstanding warrant for an alleged role in an August 2017 attack on a military base in Valencia. Another had been previously arrested during anti-government protests in 2014.  An obscure group called the “Soldiers in T-shirts” claimed responsibility for the attack on social media, saying the military had shot down its drones.  “We demonstrated that they are vulnerable. We didn’t have success today, but it’s just a question of time,” the group said.  Colombia has denied any involvement in the plot, while U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said Sunday that if Venezuela had any hard information on a U.S. link to the attempted assassination, it should hand it over.  Diego Moya-Ocampos, senior analyst for the Americas at IHS Country Risk, said it was difficult to independently verify who was behind the attack. But the embarrassing optics of the incident, which had highlighted the vulnerability of the government’s security apparatus, meant a hardline response from Maduro’s government was very likely.  “We saw soldiers breaking rank, fleeing the scene, terrorized,” he told VICE News. “The government is highly likely to respond with a purge within the security apparatus, and probably stage a crackdown against opposition and union groups which have been staging protests in the past month.”  He said little was known about the “Soldiers in T-shirts,” a group which had first announced its existence on social media during anti-government protests in 2014, and had later expressed support for Oscar Perez, a rogue police officer who commandeered a helicopter to launch an attack on government buildings last year. Perez and several of his associates were later killed in a gun battle after more than six months on the run.  If the assassination attempt was indeed the work of a radical Venezuelan militant group, Moya-Ocampos said, the attack would show an increased capability of such cells, and make further attacks more likely, raising the risk of a low-level insurgency.  Maduro, a former bus driver who sees himself as continuing the socialist revolution of his mentor and predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, has faced growing opposition as the country struggles with crippling hyperinflation, and dire food and medicine shortages. He won re-election for another six-year term in May in a deeply-flawed vote which the opposition, whose top candidates were barred from running, decried as a farce.  READ:  Venezuelans continue their exodus after Maduro’s re-election  “The government is increasingly shutting down any means of a peaceful democratic solution,” said Moya-Ocampos. “Because it’s impossible to push for a political or negotiated solution, opposition groups are turning to political violence as the only way to force regime change.” Cover image: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro delivers a speech during a ceremony to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the National Guard in Caracas on August 4, 2018 day in which Venezuela's controversial Constituent Assembly marks its first anniversary.(JUAN BARRETO/AFP/Getty Images)",a-crackdown-is-underway-after-venezuelas-president-was-attacked-with-exploding-drones.txt,drew.uq

"The Clinton campaign is saying that they won't agree to a debate with Bernie Sanders in New York because they're offended by Sanders's recent ""tone."" This is plainly ridiculous. The reason Clinton's people don't want a debate before the New York primary is there's no upside for them in a debate before the New York primary. Their polling, as of now, shows Clinton winning the state's massive delegate haul, and a debate would simply be an opportunity to screw that up. The problem is that their reasoning, though tactically correct, would strike people as rather less than sporting. So the Clinton campaign has come up with the argument that Sanders has somehow crossed a line with his negative campaigning. ""They’re talking about running harsher negatives now,"" Joel Benenson, Clinton's pollster, complained to CNN. This is flatly absurd. The Democratic primary — including the debates — has been substantive and respectful. Sanders has, at times, bent over backward to run a positive race, as when he refused to hound Clinton over her emails. If any candidate has ever proven himself a fair and courteous adversary, it's Sanders. The mockery Sanders's supporters are throwing at Clinton is entirely merited. This is the Clinton campaign at its worst. The argument isn't just false, it also insults the intelligence of voters. The message is that debates are something Clinton graciously concedes to rather than participates in as part of the democratic process. And the whole effort baits and annoys the Sanders supporters whom Clinton ultimately needs to win over. Politics ain't beanbag. If the Clinton campaign doesn't want another debate, no one can force them into it. But if they didn't want another debate, they should have just said so, and offered some anodyne excuse like they wanted to spend more time campaigning in New York and less time campaigning on television. Trying to place the blame on Sanders for the fact that they are refusing to debate is just dirty, and it cheapens the tone of this race far more than anything the Sanders campaign has done recently.",the-clinton-campaigns-excuse-for-not-debating-sanders-is-ridiculous.txt,drew.uq

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 45 minutes, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a steady, consistent pressure. 6. Remove the pressure cooker from the heat and let the pressure come down for 15 minutes. Carefully release any remaining gentle pressure by releasing the valve and letting the pot sand for 3 to 4 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. 7. Using tongs, transfer the brisket to a plate and set aside. Place the pot with the braising liquid over high heat and simmer the sauce until reduced and slightly thickened. 8. Slice the brisket against the grain and sprinkle with salt. 9. To serve, heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. In a small bowl, mix the butter with the garlic and brush on the inside of the buns. Toast the buns, flipping once, until golden, about 1 minute per side. Pile the brisket high on the inside of the bottom bun and drizzle with a little of the reduced BBQ sauce. Pile high with broccoli slaw and top with the top half of the bun. Make a large platter for the family or for on game day. From How-To: Make Quick BBQ Brisket with Guy Fieri",bbq-brisket.txt,drew.uq
"(Reuters) - An appeal filed by the owner of Maximum Security, the horse that finished first in the Kentucky Derby on Saturday but was later disqualified for interference, was denied by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission on Monday.  The appeal was filed by an attorney for Gary West, whose horse became the first winner to be disqualified for an on-track infraction.   The racing commission called the request “moot” because the decision to disqualify Maximum Security and install second-placed Country House as winner was not subject to appeal.  “The stewards unanimously disqualified Maximum Security following two objections lodged immediately after the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby and after a thorough review of the race replay,” the commission wrote in a letter.   “That determination is not subject to an appeal.”  After a 20-minute video review, officials found that Maximum Security, who was 4-1 favorite to win the 1-1/4 mile race, was guilty of a contact foul when he appeared to take a wide turn and impede other horses in the home stretch.  The disqualification ruling handed the win to Country House, which had been a 65-1 long shot.  West told NBC’s “Today” earlier on Monday that the dramatic turn on events at Churchill Downs left him “stunned, shocked and in total disbelief” and that his bay colt would not be in the field for the May 18 Preakness Stakes, the second leg of U.S. thoroughbred horse racing’s Triple Crown.  “It was literally like the old TV show, ‘The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat’, all within a 22-minute period of time,” said West, who owns Maximum Security with his wife.  “Winning it was the most euphoric thing I have probably ever had in our lives and disappointment when they took the horse down for the first time in history, we were stunned, shocked and in total disbelief. It had never been done before.”  The decision even caught the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who said on Twitter the disqualification of Maximum Security could only happen in “these days of political correctness”.  West said he did see Maximum Security, who led from nearly start to finish, move over several lanes but felt such contact was inevitable given the number of horses allowed to race in the Kentucky Derby, which usually features 20 horses but this year had 19 year after a late scratch.  “Churchill Downs, because they’re a greedy organization, has (20 horses) rather than 14 like you have in the Kentucky Oaks, the Breeders’ Cup, every other race in America,” said West.  “Just because they can make more money, they’re willing to risk horses’ lives and peoples’ lives to do that. I’m not a fan of that. I think they ought to have 14 like every other race.,” said West.  “Yes I saw the horse move out, but every Kentucky Derby, you could sit down two or three or four horses if you wanted to, because it’s like a rodeo out there.”  When asked for comment, Churchill Downs Racetrack President Kevin Flanery said in an email to Reuters that the infraction by Maximum Security had nothing to do with the number of horses in the race and that there is no evidence to the contrary.  West said there would be no rematch with Country House when Baltimore’s Pimlico Race Course hosts the Preakness Stakes.  “We are not going to run The Preakness,” said West. “There’s no Triple Crown on the line for us, and no reason to run a horse back in two weeks when you don’t have to.”  Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Additional reporting by Gabriella Borter; Editing by Bill Trott, Ed Osmond and Pritha Sarkar",horse-racing-appeal-over-kentucky-derby-disqualification-denied.txt,drew.uq
"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche’s $4.3 billion takeover of U.S. gene therapy specialist Spark Therapeutics has been pushed back again, possibly beyond the first half, as regulators continue to scrutinize the deal for its effect on competition.  Roche said on Monday that both companies received a request for more information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in connection with the FTC’s review of the deal, sending Spark shares down nearly 15% at $93 in premarket trading on Monday.    Roche also said that the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has opened an investigation.  Roche wants to buy Spark to, among other things, get a hold of U.S. firm’s experimental gene therapy for hemophilia A as well as its platform to develop other treatments for genetic diseases. But Roche has been forced to push back completion repeatedly, this time giving itself to July 31, beyond its self-imposed first-half deadline, to wrap things up.  “The parties remain committed to the transaction and are working cooperatively and expeditiously with the FTC in connection with its review,” Roche said in a statement.  The FTC has said it does not comment on cases it is reviewing.  The British regulator’s separate inquiry is aimed at determining whether the CMA considers it has jurisdiction over Roche’s acquisition, and if so, whether it could hurt competition in Britain.   “Pending the outcome of its investigation, the CMA has issued an Interim Enforcement Order that would become effective upon closing of the transaction and would require Roche to hold separate the Spark business,” Roche said. “The parties are working cooperatively with the CMA and will continue to do so.”  Reporting by John Miller; Additional reporting by Tamara Mathias; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Anil D'Silva",roches-43-billion-spark-bid-delayed-again-amid-us-uk-scrutiny.txt,drew.uq
"New Zealand police revealed Wednesday that the gunman who shot and killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch last Friday planned to attack a third target. “We strongly believe we stopped him on the way to a further attack, so lives were saved,” Commissioner Mike Bush told reporters at a press conference in Christchurch. The suspect, who has been charged with murder, attacked the Masjid Al Noor mosque near the center of the city, killing dozens of people, then got in his car and drove a few miles to the Linwood Islamic Centre. He was arrested soon after, but authorities say he would have continued his attack had he not been stopped. Bush declined to give further details about the location of the third target, or whether it was another mosque, so as not to “traumatize others.” The revelation came as the first victims of the atrocity were buried Wednesday. Khalid Mustafa, 44, and his 15-year-old son, Hamza Mustafa, who had arrived in New Zealand from Syria last year, were the first to be buried.

A boy of 3, born in New Zealand to Somali refugee parents, was also buried. READ: No one reported the Christchurch massacre while it was being live streamed However, families of some of the victims have voiced frustration at the delay in releasing the bodies. Postmortems have been completed on all 50 victims, but just 30 bodies have been released so far. There are still 29 people in the hospital as a result of injuries suffered in the attacks, with eight of them in critical condition. Prime Minister Jacinta Ardern said Wednesday she understood the frustration of the families given that Islamic funerals typically take place as soon as possible after death, but she added that she had “seen those who are working on this process as well and I can also acknowledge that they are working incredibly hard too.” Ardern announced that the country would hold a two-minute time of silence Friday to honor those who died in the attacks, and that the Islamic call to prayer would be broadcast on public TV and radio stations as a show of support for the Muslim community. The Al Noor mosque announced it would hold Friday prayers this week, one week after the gunman killed 42 people there. “We are going to prayer here on Friday,” Imam Gamal Fouda, the mosque’s religious leader, told the New Zealand Herald. “The majority of people, including myself, we decided to come and prayer close to our site. We will never forsake it to please those people who actually attacked us.” As New Zealand continues to mourn the worst terrorist attack in its history, terrorist organizations are seeking to use the attack to their advantage.  Islamic State spokesperson Abu Hassan Al Muhajir issued a 44-minute speech Tuesday calling on supporters to seek revenge. “The scenes of the massacres in the two mosques should wake up those who were fooled, and should incite the supporters of the caliphate to avenge their religion,” he said. This was the first statement in six months from Al Muhajir, a recluse so secretive that no one knows what he looks like, highlighting the significance of the speech.

"(Reuters) - Mississippi’s Republican governor said on Thursday he planned to join a lawsuit by officials from 11 states to overturn an Obama administration directive that tells schools to let transgender students use bathrooms matching their gender identity.  The lawsuit led by Texas, the most significant legal challenge to this month’s directive, said the federal government and Obama administration officials overreached their authority by taking actions that should be left to Congress or individual states.  “Our office has talked to the Texas attorney general’s office and I intend, as soon as possible, to join the lawsuit against this latest example of federal overreach,” Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said in a statement.  As with some of the other states, Mississippi’s governor and attorney general disagree on the suit, which challenges the administration’s interpretation that federal civil rights laws against sex discrimination should apply to transgender people.  Mississippi’s attorney general, Democrat Jim Hood, declined to participate in the lawsuit, according to Clay Chandler, a spokesman for the governor. Chandler said Bryant will work with an attorney in the governor’s office in joining the lawsuit.  Hood’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Amid a national debate on transgender rights, President Barack Obama’s administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority.  Texas was joined by Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin, plus Arizona’s Department of Education and Maine’s governor.  The lawsuit said the administration “conspired to turn workplace and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights.”  Transgender rights advocates criticized the suit as a malicious attack, saying there have never been public safety incidents or invasions of privacy related to protections for transgender people.  “While the department will review the complaint, the federal government has strong legal foundations to uphold the civil rights of transgender Americans,” the Justice Department said in a statement on Wednesday.

"An exhibition at El Museo del Barrio brings us to the thorny side of profound themes like martyrdom and labor. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads After nearly a year of renovations, El Museo del Barrio has opened with a show that couldn’t be better suited to this moment: Liliana Porter: Other Situations. A traveling exhibition from the SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, Georgia, curated by their own Humberto Moro, the show features only 32 works, but they span Porter’s decades-long career and highlight the wry wit and incisive perspective of this artist who deserves more prominence in the US. From drawing, to prints and photographs, to sculptures, installations, and films, Porter’s work, no matter its form, demands a kind of noticing, a paying attention that, in many ways, can only be done in the context of a museum or a gallery. Like the white void that she places her objects and ideas within, the act of isolation is crucial to the humor and the dark questions that permeate her work. Liliana Porter, “Martyr [Martir]” (2005), archival digital print, El Museo del Barrio, 2018Liliana Porter, “Mouse Pad Artwork [Arte de Mouse Pad]” (2004), archival digital print, El Museo del Barrio, 2018 In a bustling grocery store, stacked high with wares, packed with customers, and filled with the white noise of commerce, you might otherwise never notice a diminutive slice of soft cheese named after a nineteen year old woman who was burned at the stake. Plucked by the ever-vigilant Porter and placed on an open plain in a photograph, one is forced to confront the object on its own terms. What is the flavor of martyrdom? Of betrayal? Of a woman being burned at the stake? Does it pair best with a dark cracker or a crusty loaf? But it’s not just the cheese. Here, this work is laid out with two others in a triptych. Beside Joan of Arc sits Che Guevara, in this instance rendered by the manufacturer as a “Martyr Mousepad.” On the other side of Joan is a sugar Jesus wrapped in cellophane, paired with another Jesus flipped over to reveal the price and ingredients in this most unholy body of Christ. Seeing the works and their depicted objects together, a more complex set of meanings unfold, a strange alliance. And also a much thornier inquiry into martyrdom itself. As anti-Muslim sentiment continues to simmer and regularly boil over in the US, it’s virtually impossible in this context not to think of the particular way that news stories describe Muslim individuals being killed or committing suicidal acts of violence in the name of their religious and/or political views, whether in Syria, Palestine, Iraq, or here in the US. The West bends over backwards to paint those acts by Muslims as deeply other, foreign, and backward; as untenable in white, Judeo-Christian nations. Reminders of those moments certainly aren’t on offer in the box stores and supermarkets that line our streets, rendered in sugar, or cream, or foam. Rather than a cruel sneer or an act of distancing, the darker political and philosophical questions contained in some of Porter’s work draw the viewer in, inviting you to sift through your own trinkets and fallibility. An invitation offered by a child’s toy, or a cheap miniature that feels both familiar and enticing is quite a different thing than a pundit decrying the other side, whichever side it is. Would I have bought that slice of cheese and laughed about it over wine? I might have. How many people walk the streets in t-shirts or paper their walls with images of Che Guevara — a silhouette rendered so meaningless through mass consumerism that many who don his face have no idea who he is or what exactly he did after his youthful motorcycle journey. An Argentine who has lived in the US since 1964, Porter maintains her relationship with Argentina, and also maintains a steady popularity in Latin America. There, her work has been exhibited regularly since her first show at the age of seventeen, during a time when she was living in Mexico with her family. The rise and fall of so many socialist and revolutionary governments in Central and South America since her birth in 1941, including in Argentina, and the bloody involvement of the US in countless coups, assassinations, and armed conflicts there, is something that is almost entirely absent in US history courses, nor is it present in the consciousness of many in this country. Yet, hypocrisy and complicity are something that someone with feet in both the north and the south can’t help but take in. Perhaps the funniest work in this show to touch on the ideas above, is a large-scale photograph titled simply “Memorabilia” (2016). Again, against a blank, edgeless backdrop, Porter has arranged a group of figurines, ceramic objects, and other cheaply manufactured items, each featuring the image of political figures ranging from China’s Mao Zedong to France’s Napoleon Bonaparte to the US’s George Washington and John F. Kennedy to Argentina’s Eva Perón. For some in the US, they might jar at seeing Washington or Kennedy next to Mao or Napoleon. But again, it’s a matter of framing, of the narrative you spin. And though largely silent, Porter’s work is very much about the stories you spin while looking at it. Installation view Liliana Porter, “Man Painting [Hombre pintando]” (2018), mixed media, El Museo del Barrio, 2018Installation view Liliana Porter, “Trabajo Forzado (Mujer barriendo) [Forced Labor (Sweeping Woman)]” (2004-2018), mixed media, El Museo del Barrio, 2018Installation view Liliana Porter, “The Task (Black Piano) [La area (piano negro)” (2016), mixed media, El Museo del Barrio, 2018 Another theme that appears frequently in the works on display is that of labor, of tiny workers bent steadily into tasks, the enormity of which simultaneously dwarfs and enlarges each laborer. If you were to stitch together all the clothing sewn by a garment worker, or to lay out all the walls that a house painter has ever painted, as these works seem to invite us to do, you might be struck by the endlessness of those tasks. The janitor who returns each night to make clean what will only be made dirty tomorrow; the homemaker who cooks one meal, only to do it again in a few hours. I couldn’t help but think of Hannah Arendt’s brilliant writing in her book The Human Condition while looking at these works: “It is indeed the mark of all laboring that it leaves nothing behind, that the result of its effort is almost as quickly consumed as the effort is spent. And yet this effort, despite its futility, is born of a great urgency and motivated by a more powerful drive than anything else, because life itself depends upon it.” Feminist thinkers and labor observers have long noted the invisibility and complete lack or paltry nature of the payments that many laborers are given in our society. In the context of El Museo, it’s not a far leap to consider the ways in which Latin American labor, particularly Central American labor, has been exploited, manipulated, and discarded in this country. And this is just a taste of what this relatively concise but incredibly rich show can elicit. The two digital videos that are part of the exhibit, “Actualidades / Breaking News” (2016) and “Matinee” (2009), introduce new ideas, but also revisit figures and suggestions that appear elsewhere in Porter’s work. Moving imagery is a form that works incredibly well for her. A deft sense of selection and grouping, paired with timing and soundscapes, offers a novel approach that builds new meanings. There’s tremendous fodder for thoughtful consideration, ready laughter, and recognition in these works. By calling and holding our attention on things that can easily be taken for granted, Porter quietly and with a mischievous smile, nudges us to reconsider everything we see. Liliana Porter: Other Situations continues at El Museo del Barrio (1230 5th Ave, Manhattan) through January 27, 2019.

"With a population of just over 11,000, Dobbs Ferry, New York is your typical sleepy town, except for one thing: When the first school bell rings, kids actually feel awake. Prior to the 2015-2016 school year, Dobbs Ferry middle schoolers started at 8:15 a.m. and high schoolers at 7:30 a.m. Under the new policy, both schools now start approximately 30 minutes later and end 15 minutes later. In making those changes, the Dobbs Ferry School District joined a small but growing group of middle and high schools around the US that have started pushing back their start times in an effort to combat grogginess. The changes are bolstered by a mountain of sleep science research that says pre-teens and teenagers are some of society's most sleep-deprived people and would actually do better in school with more rest. These forward-thinking schools are finally listening — and letting kids sleep in. What happens when you start later? A new study involving 30,000 high-school students across 29 schools in seven states found that graduation rates and attendance rates both went up in the two years after schools pushed start times to at least 8:30 a.m. Dobbs Ferry Superintendent Dr. Lisa Brady tells Business Insider that the schools there have experienced tremendous benefits. Following a survey issued at the end of the 2015-2016 school year (the first full year with later start times), Brady says ""it was clear from both the parents and the kids, overwhelmingly, that the mornings were just less stressful."" Many of the kids reported having more time to eat breakfast and get ready for school, while parents said they didn't have to drag kids out of bed or yell at them to hurry up. Once students got to school, they felt more alert. At night, they tended to reported going to bed at the same time, even though the new schedule freed up an extra 45 minutes. Other schools have seen similar benefits. In Seattle, 85% of middle and high schools in the 2016-2017 school year swapped start times with the elementary schools. Now the older kids start at 8:45 while the youngsters start at 7:55. Kira Hoffman, an eighth-grader at Jane Addams Middle School, told KUOW that she ""no longer feels super-rushed or worried about how much I've slept, or when I'm going to get to school, or if I'm going to be late."" In Pennsylvania, a new hope So far, hundreds of schools in 44 states have jumped on the late-start bandwagon, according to advocacy group Start School Later, which has been compiling a list of US schools and districts that have pushed back the first bell. One of those is Solebury School in New Hope, Pennsylvania, where Director of Studies Rick Tony pushed for a robust set of changes to the school schedule. Kids at Solebury, a private boarding and day school, now start at 8:30 a.m most days, and 9:00 a.m. on Wednesdays. In years past, the first bell sounded promptly at 8. The school also moved from six 50-minute classes per day to four 80-minute classes. With fewer teachers to assign homework, Tony says, kids can still enjoy their nights even if they get home slightly later. ""Every time we ask for feedback, the results come back 10 to 1, positive to negative,"" he tells Business Insider. Tony also teaches math, and says his students are already producing better work on a more consistent basis, even though the schedule is just six months old. Around campus, he says, kids seem more relaxed since they're not juggling as much work early in the day. ""The freneticism is definitely reduced this year,"" he says, adding that he plans to follow up with teachers to get harder data about student achievement. The downsides of delaying start times Negative responses to later start times are rare, but they do happen. Lisa Brady says some parents in Dobbs Ferry have found it harder to complete the necessary morning rituals and still get to work on time. Meanwhile, Rick Tony says the issue at Solebury is finding enough buses for kids. In both cases, officials say parents have the option to drop their kids off at school before the first bell so they can eat breakfast, charge their devices, or just hang out. Brady has also found challenges with after-school athletics and clubs. In years prior, teams had no trouble getting to away games. Now they have less time to get there, and they have to deal with worse traffic. ""The kids feel really rushed,"" she says. Many kids also say they have less time to do homework once they finally get home. Brady says the Dobbs Ferry schools are brainstorming potential changes to the school day similar to those made at Solebury. It takes a village In districts where schools have not started to take sleep science research into account, parents have begun to speak up. An op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times in September 2016 included voices from frustrated parents who were fed up with coaxing bleary-eyed adolescents to get dressed. ""I have been saying for years that kids, especially high school students, should not be expected to be in their seats trying to learn anything in the early morning hours,"" a parent named Paula Del said. When asked why more schools have yet to take her district's lead, Brady speculated that it has something to do with generational pride. Even if the science is rock-solid, many administrators and parents simply don't pity the sleepy teen. Waking up is hard, but it's a part of life. ""I get that years ago we all walked 100 miles in the snow to school,"" Brady says. ""But we know better now about the adolescent brain, and we know about their natural sleep rhythms being different than adults'.""",school-start-times-getting-pushed-back-in-response-to-sleep-science.txt,drew.uq
"Pressure is mounting on Wall Street to do something about gun control. Investment firms are reexamining their portfolios, dropping gun stocks, and asking weapons manufacturers what they are doing to make sure their products don't end up in a mass shooting. This reevaluation comes as public anger over political inaction on gun control shifts toward the American companies that profit from gun sales. It started with social media calls for companies — like Hertz, MetLife, and Delta — to end their partnerships with the National Rifle Association. Many of the companies targeted did. Now Wall Street firms are coming under fire for investing retirement savings and pension funds in companies like American Outdoor Brands, which makes the AR-15 rifle used in the Parkland shooting. Last week, New Jersey lawmakers moved to restrict all state employee pension funds from investing in gun manufacturers. Joanne McCall, president of the Florida Education Association, is urging state lawmakers to do the same. Shareholders at American Outdoor Brands, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and Sturm Ruger asked those companies to report on steps they’re taking to improve gun safety and mitigate gun violence. The requests were filed by religious groups linked to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which includes 300 institutional investors that manage $400 billion in assets, according to Bloomberg. (Dick’s Sporting Goods on Wednesday announced that it was ending sales of assault-style weapons at its stores.) Meanwhile, reports that major 401(k) index funds run by Vanguard and TIAA-CREF have ownership stakes in the big three gunmakers have also prompted a social-media backlash: Time to divest from the gun industry, @TIAA and @Vanguard_Group. #NeverAgain https://t.co/70qYEIk4NP Wall Street has noticed. The investment firm BlackRock, which owns the largest stake in American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger, said it has reached out to gun industry executives to see what they plan to do about gun violence. Blackstone Group, another Wall Street investment firm, sent an email to fund managers over the weekend, asking them whether they have any stakes in the gun manufacturers. Other investment firms are renewing efforts to keep gun stocks out of their portfolio — efforts that have been building since the Sandy Hook massacre. The movement is the latest example of American voters channeling their frustration into consumer boycotts when political action fails. Pressure has been building in recent years for Wall Street firms to dump gun stocks — ever since the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting that killed 20 children in 2012. Put simply, divestment is when an organization or individual sells shares of stock in a given company or sector. Activists have been using divestment as a political strategy for decades — as far back as apartheid-era South Africa. Since then, divestment has become a grassroots movement to urge ordinary consumers to invest their retirement savings in ethical ways, and even to use them as vehicles for political change, such as with the divestment movement targeting fossil fuels. It was considered an effective strategy in apartheid South Africa. Opponents of the apartheid regime focused their ire on the companies that were directly invested in the country. They began urging institutional investors, including universities, to divest their assets from companies that did business with the regime. Archbishop Desmond Tutu credited the divestment campaign as a key tactic in bringing down apartheid. The concept of divesting became mainstream in the United States during the climate change debate. Frustration over what was viewed as weak UN climate agreements, plus the US Senate's failure to pass a climate bill in 2010, pushed foundations and nonprofit groups —such as Greenpeace — to ensure their investments were not going to big oil companies. Activist celebrities, like Leonardo DiCaprio, popularized the idea, encouraging Americans to make sure their retirement money was invested in renewable energy. In 2015, a group of foundations launched the DivestInvest initiative, which helps foundations, individuals and businesses divest from fossil fuels. In recent years, gun-control activists have turned to divestiture as a tactic. Rapper Snoop Dogg and angel investor Ron Conway joined the Campaign to Unload, launched in the wake of Sandy Hook and featuring the hashtag #UnloadYour401k. In 2016, two tech workers created Goodbye Gun Stocks, a web app that allowed users to see if their 401(k) savings were invested in gun stocks. One of the creators, Keywon Chung, said she was inspired to take the idea of fossil-fuel divestitures to the gun debate. Asset managers say that more and more Americans have been adamant about restricting firearms companies from these funds. And it’s having an impact. According to a 2016 US SIF: The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment report, some $845 billion in assets were affected by divestment targeting military contractors and weapons makers. That's a jump of about 1,042 percent since the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012. (Only $74 billion in institutional investments restricted guns at the beginning of 2012.) Calls to divest from Remington, which made the AR-15 used in Sandy Hook, are one factor that pushed the company into bankruptcy. Cerberus, the investment firm that owned the largest stake in the company, told Bloomberg that it decided to sell the company ""amid pressure from investors revolted by the carnage"" in Sandy Hook. Business was bad for gun makers even before the latest mass shooting. Remington announced its bankruptcy on February 12 — two days before the massacre in Parkland. Stocks began to tumble for American Outdoor Brands the day after the Parkland shooter killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, following reports that the weapon used in the shooting was an AR-15 made by the Massachusetts-based company, formerly known as Smith & Wesson. Since then, the company's stocks have dropped about 12.5 percent. Stock prices for the other two big gun makers have dropped too. Gun companies had been struggling ever since Trump won the presidential election. Gun sales normally spike when Democrats are in power, as gun owners’ fears of gun-control measures rise. With Trump in power, sales have fallen. Stock prices for gun manufacturers also tend to rise after mass shootings, likely because the debate over gun control heats up and rekindles fears from gun owners. For example, stock prices for American Outdoor Brands spiked in the week following the 2016 shooting that killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, and again after the October shooting that killed 58 people at a Las Vegas concert. Reaction to the Parkland shooting seems different. Renewed calls for gun control haven't had the effect of boosting gun stock prices. In fact, they continue to fall.",gun-stocks-divestment-parkland-shooting-has-made-gun-stocks-toxic-assets-on-wall-street.txt,drew.uq
"If there were any doubt as to just how toxic sectarian politics has become in the Middle East, the latest statement from the leader of the Iran-backed Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah should clear things right up. Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of a group that has been fighting Israel for decades, declared on Tuesday that “Wahhabism is more evil than Israel,” Lebanon’s Al Akhbar newspaper reported. Wahhabism is the ultra-fundamentalist strain of Sunni Islam that Saudi Arabia’s government promotes and that strongly influences the ideology of Sunni jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. In other words, things have gotten so bad that Hezbollah, Israel’s mortal enemy, now considers Wahhabis — that is, fellow Muslims — to be worse than Israel. Bear in mind, this is coming from the same man who has described Israel as “a cancerous entity and the root of all the crises and wars” and pledged that Israel’s destiny “is manifested in our motto: 'Death to Israel.’” It’s also coming from a man at the helm of a group that has engaged in numerous conflicts with Israel, including a horrifically bloody all-out war in 2006 that resulted in the deaths of around 1,300 Lebanese, mostly civilians, and 165 Israelis, 121 of whom were soldiers. Israeli security officials say the group now has the capacity to batter their country with more than 1,000 rockets a day. But despite how it may seem, Nasrallah’s statement is not, at its base, a conflict about religion. Though there are certainly strong religious disagreements between Sunni and Shia — and especially between extreme fundamentalist Sunnis and extreme fundamentalist Shia — the conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia has little to do with dogma. It’s actually about something far less exotic: power and influence. Tehran’s Shia government and Riyadh’s Sunni one have spent years waging a Cold War–style proxy fight for dominance of the Middle East and the broader Muslim world. The two countries haven’t openly fought each other, but they back extremist groups around the Middle East who share their worldviews — and who are willing to fight, kill, and die on their behalf. This proxy war plays out in conflicts all over the Middle East. For instance, Saudi Arabia, with US military assistance, is engaged in a brutal air war against Iranian-backed Houthi fighters inside Yemen that has sparked a massive humanitarian crisis in the impoverished country. The United Nations recently estimated that at least 10,000 civilians have died, and acknowledged that that number was almost certainly lower than the actual toll. Saudi Arabia’s proxy fight with Iran is also helping to fuel the bloodshed in Syria, where an estimated 400,000 people have been killed over the past five years while millions more have fled the country and sparked the biggest refugee crisis in decades. Hezbollah — the strongest and most influential of Iran’s various surrogate groups — has sent between 5,000 and 8,000 fighters to Syria on behalf of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against them are myriad secular and Islamist groups, including some more extreme Wahhabi-influenced groups that are being supported by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia wants its preferred groups to topple Assad in order to remove the pro-Iranian leader and install a more Saudi-friendly (preferably Sunni) regime. Iran, naturally, would very much like to prevent that from happening. In the past few weeks, the hottest front in the showdown between Saudi Arabia and Iran has taken place online, in the press, and on social media. The New York Times published a scathing op-ed by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in which Tehran’s top diplomat argued that “the key driver of violence” in the Middle East has been Wahhabism, the “extremist ideology promoted by Saudi Arabia.” Saudi Arabia responded by publishing a series of tweets from its US embassy’s official Twitter account accusing Iran of having “supported violent extremist groups all over the world” and stating that “Iran or its proxies have been blamed for terrorist attacks around the world.” The new statement from Hezbollah’s secretary general may be the latest attack in this ongoing tit-for-tat war of words playing out across the internet, but it won’t be the last. The proxy war between the two countries, sadly, also shows no signs of coming to a peaceful end anytime soon.",the-head-of-hezbollah-has-found-someone-he-hates-even-more-than-israelis.txt,drew.uq
"A large Uber shareholder has made an investment in chief U.S. rival Lyft, part of the latest twist in the entangled web of ride-sharing deals. Lyft said on Tuesday that Fidelity, the giant mutual fund, would participate in an expanded financing round that now values the company at $11.5 billion. The round, led by Alphabet affiliate CapitalG, was previously only expected to collect $1 billion; it now stands to raise $1.5 billion. Shareholders typically try to avoid conflicts of interest in their investments, but when it comes to Uber and Lyft it seems like all’s fair. Alphabet, for example, is also invested in both Uber and Lyft. Fidelity declined to comment. Fidelity’s ownership position in Uber is almost certainly much larger than its position in Lyft — Fidelity led $1.2 billion Uber’s Series D financing round in 2014. Notably, Fidelity was a key investor that helped oust Uber’s CEO Travis Kalanick this summer. Lyft and Uber are locked in a tightening battle for market share in the U.S. and are both stockpiling cash to win it. Lyft does not need the cash right now — but investments in frontier areas like autonomous vehicles demand a healthy war chest and Lyft is accepting the cash when it is on the table. Uber is itself preparing to take on at least $1 billion in new investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. SoftBank has threatened to also invest in Lyft if it is unable to close its Uber investment. Axios earlier reported the expanded financing round.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress moved rapidly on Thursday to send President Donald Trump a short-term funding bill to avert a government shutdown this weekend, leaving fights over budget priorities and a range of other controversial issues for the coming weeks.  The House of Representatives, working against a Friday midnight deadline, approved legislation in a 235-193 vote to fund a wide range of federal programs through Dec. 22.   The Senate followed up by approving the bill 81-14. The White House has said Trump will sign it into law.  The measure creates more time for a reckoning between Republicans and Democrats about budget differences, which Trump discussed in a meeting with leading lawmakers at the White House earlier in the day.  “We hope that we’re going to make some great progress for our country. I think that will happen,” Trump said.  The White House said negotiations would resume on Friday.  Leaders now have about two weeks to find common ground on a host of thorny issues for the next government funding bill in order to prevent a partial government shutdown on Dec. 23.  Both sides want to avoid having parts of the government close, particularly during the holidays, for fear of a public backlash, and leaders from both parties have preemptively blamed the other for such a potential outcome.   That political blame game is likely to continue in the next two weeks while, behind the scenes, leaders hammer out a compromise.    Republicans mainly want a big increase in defense spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2018. But Democrats are insisting that any added Pentagon funding be accompanied by increases to other domestic programs.  Democrats also want to enact into law protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were children when they were brought into the United States.   Republicans want a much wider series of immigration law changes to further clamp down on foreign arrivals, and they want immigration negotiations to be held on a separate track from the government funding bill.  Democrats also want to shore up the Affordable Care Act, known as “Obamacare,” by reviving federal subsidies for low-income people in the program.  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer joined Trump and Republican congressional leaders for the talks after canceling a similarly planned meeting last week when the president posted a note on Twitter attacking their policy positions.  The two Democrats said in a statement that the meeting on Thursday was productive but nothing specific had been agreed. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis joined the group to discuss military matters.  The White House foresees a compromise with lawmakers that will include increases in defense and non-defense spending, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told Reuters.   He said the White House wants a deal that covers spending for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.    Earlier on Thursday, Schumer said Trump seemed to be rooting for a shutdown and warned that, if one occurs, “it will fall on his shoulders.”   “His party controls the Senate, the House and the presidency,” he said. “Nobody here wants to see a shutdown. We Democrats are not interested in one.”  Pelosi said Democrats were not willing to shut down the government over the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) immigration program, but she also said “we will not leave here without a DACA fix.”  Reporting by Richard Cowan and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell and Steve Holland; Editing by Peter Cooney, Alistair Bell and Lisa Shumaker",congress-averts-government-shutdown-for-now.txt,drew.uq
"How do you solve a problem like Aladdin? Disney’s questionable live-action remake of its acclaimed 1992 animated film, which finally hits theaters May 24, has been dogged by controversy and skepticism since before production even began. Director Guy Ritchie, known for action comedies but not musicals, seemed an unlikely choice to direct the story, especially given the tricky cultural nuances involved. Casting Will Smith as an infrequently blue genie also raised plenty of eyebrows. But more crucially, the 1992 film Aladdin seemed a completely unsuitable candidate for Disney’s series of live-action remakes. There’s too much about the original film that’s lightning in a bottle, impossible to recreate. The 1992 film’s 2D animated effects, at the time sophisticated and dazzling, are now largely passé. (2D animation is a dying style, and the computer effects that looked thrillingly state-of-the-art 27 years ago now look sadly dated.) Its reliance on Robin Williams’s genius improvisational skills led to its whip-smart, slightly manic screenplay, which was completely overhauled and frenetically rewritten under tight time constraints, not unlike the notorious crunch times that video game developers often push through today. Then there’s the collaborative gifts of Disney’s musical auteurs, composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman. Ashman originally pitched the film to Disney, but died during its development; Menken contributed the score to the new film but only one new song, with lyrics by songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. 2019’s Aladdin tries its best to regenerate that magic, and to its credit, it finds some success. It is frequently quite charming, largely thanks to the efforts of Mena Massoud, who captures Aladdin’s irrepressible charisma every second he’s onscreen. Much of the new story material written for the film works, and it’s enjoyable, if pedestrian, family fare. But the terrible musical sequences, the lackluster CGI, and the strange creative and emotional restraint that permeates the film frequently flatten Disney’s original Aladdin into a cardboard version of itself. The result is a film that’s divided into two entirely different entities. One is pretty cute: a pleasantly bland rom-com, with Massoud’s Aladdin and Naomi Scott’s Jasmine as adorable kids in love. The other is a really crappy musical, presided over by a disappointingly hamstrung Will Smith. These two halves never fully cohere. It’s important to acknowledge going into the Aladdin remake that, for all the 1992 film was a delightful, hilarious animated musical masterpiece, it was also dripping in Orientalism and harmful racist depictions of Arab culture. In the original Aladdin, Jasmine is a repressed princess whose ultimate aim is to gain enough independence to marry for love rather than political expediency, which made her strikingly evolved for the time but seems hopelessly limiting now. Her father, the sultan, is a babbling, easily directed man-child. The citizens of Agrabah are frequently depicted as barbarous sword-wielders and sexualized belly dancers. The opening song, “Arabian Nights,” originally contained the ridiculously racist line “They cut off your ear if they don’t like your face / It’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home.” So it’s easy to see why Disney executives might feel that Aladdin is worth updating, if only to overwrite many of its problematic elements. But this particular remake fumbled from the start. Advocacy groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations were opposed to the film from its inception. Casting controversy threw further doubt on the whole project, as did a series of lifeless promotional photos and a recently released clip of a strangely sluggish musical performance from the film, featuring new genie Will Smith. None of this boded well for the film. Still, Ritchie and his fellow screenwriter, frequent Tim Burton collaborator John August, put in a decent effort to gloss over the previous film’s most glaring faults. On paper, Ritchie’s Aladdin offers several modern improvements: The script is especially good to Jasmine, who’s no longer the only woman in the movie and now has long-term political ambitions. The genie, who reads as culturally Arab, has a personal life and dreams of his own beyond escaping the lamp. Aladdin and Jasmine bond over growing up parentless. Hot Jafar (his official name, sorry, I don’t make the rules) doesn’t just want abstract power; he also wants to invade a few neighboring countries, because why not. These changes are clearly meant to give Aladdin additional depth; in execution, however, many of these details seem like superficial inserts. The sultan’s palace seems to be an amalgam of Muslim and South Asian cultures, probably because Scott is of South Asian descent; her dance sequences are explicitly Bollywood-flavored. This could have been an interesting opportunity for an explicit exploration of the way these two cultures interact, but the film rarely goes deeper than, uh, giving Jasmine a feminist power ballad. Throughout the first half hour or so of Aladdin, I started to think it might be able to pull out a win. The opening sequence, where we meet Aladdin as an impressively clean thief living on the streets of Agrabah, unfolds at a clip. While it can’t quite shake the vibe of a local community theater troupe hastily assembling on a soundstage, it’s still fun. We’re quickly introduced to the budding romance between Aladdin and a disguised Princess Jasmine, who bond over petty thievery and dead parents while zipping through streets and hopping across buildings as they evade capture by Agrabah street police. It’s the kind of colorful meet-cute that wouldn’t be out of place in a Netflix “summer of love” flick, and it worked for me. In fact, I would probably watch that rom-com multiple times and reblog a few Tumblr GIF sets of their love. At nearly all other times, however, the film suffers from an inexplicable sluggishness. Ritchie’s recent filmography, dating from 2009’s Sherlock Holmes, has emphasized zany foreground antics cosseted by rich background details and strong pacing. But Aladdin frequently moves slowly, almost as if Ritchie has chosen to take the film on a leisurely stroll in direct contrast to its predecessor’s high speed. This holds true not just for the musical numbers, which all seem to have been slowed down in tempo and energy, but also the big action sequences between Hot Jafar and everyone else. Watching the film, I frequently wondered, in fact, if Hot Jafar actor Marwan Kenzari were controlling the pace of the scenes through his refusal to turn his character into a campy, over-the-top villain. The original Jafar was the epitome of the noxious trope of the shrieking, fey, vaguely homophobic Disney villain; Kenzari’s Jafar is quiet, straightforward, and almost affectless, except for occasional moments when he lets his thirst for power seep through. This is a satisfying reinterpretation of Jafar, but his emotional restraint seems to be contagious. There are entire scenes, particularly near the end, where characters who should be fighting tooth and nail for what they want instead stand still and calmly reflect on what they each want to do next. It’s largely inexplicable behavior, and speaks to just how overly staid Ritchie’s direction is. CGI Abu (the monkey): Meh. CGI Magic Carpet: Perfect! 10/10, would ride. CGI visual backgrounds: Flat and unimpressive, particularly during the cave sequence and “A Whole New World.” CGI Rajah (the tiger): Delightful! 10/10, would pet. CGI Iago (the parrot): Disappointing, though more because the film mostly excised his wisecracking personality rather than because of how he looks. CGI “Friend Like Me”: Abysmal on a scale that must be seen to understand. But it’s the musical numbers in particular that seem completely deflated. It’s not just that they’re slow; it’s also that Smith’s voice doesn’t carry them like WIlliams’s did, and his lack of live stage experience really hurts him here — as does the lackluster CGI imagery overall, which makes his “phenomenal cosmic power” seem kinda drab. “Friend Like Me” especially seems uninspired visually and thematically, while “Prince Ali” has already been widely ridiculed on social media for its slow pacing and dearth of jubilance. The other songs also suffer from this weird malaise; “A Whole New World” passed by before I really even noticed it was happening. Smith, moreover, seems to be blocked creatively in his role as Genie, who comes across as a thin character despite the extra layers of characterization given to him in the new script. To be fair, it’s hard to conceive of anyone who could step into a role this iconic, played so brilliantly by Williams, and not be intimidated out of all self-expression, but Smith also quite understandably seems to present his character as spiritually worn down by his enslavement. Far from being a genie who projects phenomenal cosmic power, Smith’s interpretation is occasionally socially awkward, and human above all else. And that underscores the remake’s biggest single issue. Turning a blue cartoon into a flesh-and-blood human being imposes a sense of realism that the glib, fantastical storyline of Aladdin was never really meant to reckon with. The original “Aladdin” tale, after all, was most likely translated from a Syrian oral tradition relayed by an 18th-century French writer, who drenched his version in exoticism. The 1992 film, in turn, succeeded on the basis of its sheer disconnect from reality, which kept it fun and magical. The cartoon was divorced from its story’s real-life connections, something the live-action take can’t evade. It’s possible to imagine a new animated remake of Aladdin that confronts the Disney classic’s fraught past and manages to jettison much of its cultural baggage in a way that feels justified and transformative. Unfortunately, a live-action adaptation was never going to pull that off. I’m left mourning the infectious, charming, no-baggage, original rom-com Disney could have given us instead.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has increased tariffs by up to 25 percent on 128 U.S. products, from frozen pork and wine to certain fruits and nuts, escalating a dispute between the world’s biggest economies in response to U.S. duties on imports of aluminum and steel.   The tariffs, which take effect on Monday, were announced late on Sunday by China’s finance ministry and matched a list of possible tariffs on up to $3 billion in U.S. goods published by China on March 23.  Soon after the announcement, an editorial in the widely read Global Times newspaper warned that if the United States had thought China would not retaliate or would only take symbolic countermeasures, it could “say goodbye to that delusion”.  “Even though China and the U.S. have not publicly said they are in a trade war, the sparks of such a war have already started to fly,” the newspaper said.  The Ministry of Commerce said it was suspending its obligations to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reduce tariffs on 120 U.S. goods, including fruit and ethanol. The tariffs on those products will be raised by an extra 15 percent.  Eight other products, including pork and scrap aluminum, would now be subject to additional tariffs of 25 percent, it said, with the measures effective starting April 2.      “China’s suspension of its tariff concessions is a legitimate action adopted under WTO rules to safeguard China’s interests,” the finance ministry said.   China is moving swiftly with retaliatory action amid escalating trade tension with the United States, which has rocked global financial markets in the past week as investors fear a full-blown trade dispute between the two economic superpowers will damage world growth.  In response to China’s move, Washington said Beijing’s subsidies and overcapacity were behind the action on steel.  “Instead of targeting fairly traded U.S. exports, China needs to stop its unfair trading practices which are harming U.S national security and distorting global markets,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.  U.S. President Donald Trump is separately preparing to impose tariffs of more than $50 billion on Chinese goods following an investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act.   The U.S. administration says China has systematically misappropriated American intellectual property - allegations China denies.      About the Section 301 investigation, China had “yet to unsheathe its sword,” the official Xinhua news agency said.  Sometime this week, the Trump administration is expected to unveil a list of Chinese goods that could be subjected to new U.S. tariffs.  U.S. technology industry officials said they expected the list to target products that benefit from Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” program, which aims to upgrade the domestic manufacturing base with more advanced products.   China has repeatedly promised to open its economy further, but many foreign companies complain of unfair treatment. China warned the United States on Thursday not to open a Pandora’s Box and spark a flurry of protectionist practices across the globe.  “There are some people in the West who think that China looks tough for the sake of a domestic audience, and would easily make concessions,” the Global Times said.   “But they are wrong.”  The Global Times is run by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, although its stance does not necessarily reflect government policy.  Reaction to China’s measures varied on social media, with some saying Chinese customers would be the ones to ultimately pay for a trade war.   “Why not directly target soybean and planes? The tariffs that China announced today don’t sound a lot to me,” said a user on the Weibo microblog platform.  Aircraft and soybeans were China’s biggest U.S. imports by value last year.   In a statement published on Monday morning, the commerce ministry said the United States had “seriously violated” the principles of nondiscrimination enshrined in World Trade Organization rules, and had also damaged China’s interests.  “China’s suspension of some of its obligations to the United States is its legitimate right as a member of the World Trade Organization,” it said, adding that differences should be resolved through negotiation.   Weibo prominently featured the list of U.S. goods that China is targeting among the day’s “hot” trending topics.   “I will never buy fruit from the U.S.,” a Weibo user wrote.

It’s true that Trump’s comment last week was preceded by a sheriff mentioning MS-13, but Trump also phrased his remark in a way that left the meaning open to interpretation. “We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — and we’re stopping a lot of them — but we’re taking people out of the country,” Trump said. “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals. And we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.

Paris - Archaeologists said Tuesday they had discovered the remains of victims from a 6,000-year-old massacre in Alsace in eastern France that was likely carried out by ""furious ritualized warriors"". The corpses of 10 people were found outside Strasbourg in one of 300 ancient ""silos"" used to store grain and other food, a team from France's National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (Inrap) told reporters. The Neolithic group appeared to have died violent deaths, with multiple injuries to their legs, hands and skulls. The way in which the bodies were piled on top of each other suggested they had been killed together and dumped in the silo. ""They were very brutally executed and received violent blows, almost certainly from a stone axe,"" said Philippe Lefranc, an Inrap specialist on the period. The skeletons of five adults and one adolescent were found, as well as four arms from different individuals. The arms were likely ""war trophies"" like those found at a nearby burial site of Bergheim in 2012, said Lefranc. He said the mutilations indicated a society of ""furious ritualized warriors"", while the silos were stored within a defence wall that pointed towards ""a troubled time, a period of insecurity"". It is hoped that genetic testing on the bones will reveal more information about the killings, but Lefranc said one theory was that a local tribe had clashed with a new group arriving from the area around modern-day Paris. ""It appears that a warrior raid by people from the Parisian basin went wrong for the assailants, and the Alsatians of the era massacred them,"" he said. However, in the long run, it was the ""Parisians"" who had the last laugh. The local tribe appear to have been supplanted by the newcomers around 4,200 BC, as demonstrated by new funeral rites, pottery and hamlets.",france-unearths-bones-from-6000yrold-neolithic-massacre.txt,drew.uq

This is because underneath his extremely chill demeanor lies 18 years of bartending experience, during which he worked with some of the most notable bartenders and establishments in Los Angeles. It was that same bartending career, however, that made him burn out and lead him down the road to become 213 Hospitality's ""Spirit Guide"" (actual job title). His resume includes OK'ing the 800 whiskeys for LA's iconic whiskey bar Seven Grand and overseeing the rest of the spirits used throughout the entire 213 Hospitality empire. (Thus, the first Spirit Society sessions were strictly about whiskey.) Now, the man's goal with weekly tastings is to create community within spirits and bring people together, and to take away the pretense that can come along with some liquors. When he is done with the rum tasting, I ask him a little more about his goal for these extravagant tastings, where they never shy away from pouring you a little bit extra if you ask nicely. ""Some people might think that because our bars have leather booths and dark woods, that it is only a place for old, rich white people,"" he tells me. ""But I'm really not from this world, nor do I want anyone to think that the world of spirits is exclusive in any way."" He adds that the production and consumption of alcohol has historically helped to foster community throughout the world.  His ethos toward alcohol is one up as a skater playing in punk rock bands in Eugene, Oregon.""Our society has grown around alcohol and it has always brought humans together. I'm just trying to tear away at all of the elitist, classist, sexist marketing that booze has gone through."" His strategy in making booze approachable to all is simple: Ask what people are tasting instead of telling them what they are supposed to be tasting. ""Some people have never had some of the flavor profiles that are described on the back of labels. I just want people to know that whatever they are tasting is cool, too."" This lofty goal is seemingly becoming a reality. During another tasting that showcased some special selections of Nikka Japanese whisky at Bar Jackalope, the crowd of 75 varied from downtown executives in expensive suits to 20-somethings with hoodies who drove all the way from south and east LA. In this tasting, there were seven whiskeys being generously poured, including a special, one-off bottle that the Nikka whisky presenter made by accumulating the ends of many different Nikka whiskies over the years. The excess in booze in this tasting resulted in an even more communal environment, with even more conversations between total strangers. ""Booze has always been by the people and for the people. I just want to remind people of this fact. Whiskey is and will always be for everybody,"" he tells me later.

"JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - At least 15 people were killed on Tuesday in Afghanistan’s eastern city of Jalalabad when gunmen stormed a government building, trapping dozens inside after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance gate, officials and witnesses said.  The attack underlines the country’s dire security situation after 17 years of war. Islamic State increasingly claims attacks on civilian targets even as pressure builds for peace talks between the Western-backed government and the Taliban.  There was no immediate claim of responsibility, though the Taliban issued a statement denying involvement.  After several hours during which intermittent gunfire and explosions could be heard, provincial government spokesman Attaullah Khogyani said the incident appeared to be over with two gunmen killed and much of the building destroyed.  He said at least 15 people had been killed and 15 wounded although the total may rise as rescue workers search the site. Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the local provincial council, said eight had been killed and as many as 30 wounded.  The International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian organization working in Afghanistan, said one of its staff, a water and sanitation engineer, was among the dead.   One witness, a passerby named Obaidullah, said the attack began when a black car with three occupants pulled up at the entrance to a building used by the department of refugee affairs and a gunman emerged, firing around him.  One attacker blew himself up at the gate and two gunmen entered the building, in an area close to shops and government offices, he added.  Minutes later, the car blew up, wounding people in the street, Obaidullah said.  “We saw several people wounded and helped to carry them away,” he added.  As security forces cordoned off the area, gunshots and what appeared to be hand grenade explosions could be heard as a cloud of black smoke drifted into the sky.  Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the local provincial council, said about 40 people appeared to have been caught inside the building, which caught fire early in the attack.  As the attack concluded, it was not immediately clear what had happened to them. Islamic State has claimed a number of recent attacks in the city.  Khogyani said the attack happened during a meeting with NGOs working on refugee-related issues. The head of the department and several other people were taken to safety, he said.  Although it is unclear whether there is any direct connection, Islamic State attacks have picked up as hopes for peace talks between the government and the Taliban have grown in the wake of last month’s three-day ceasefire.  The attacks have been concentrated in Jalalabad, the main city of Nangarhar province, on the border with Pakistan where Islamic State fighters first appeared towards the end of 2014.  The casualties add to a mounting toll in Afghanistan. In the western province of Farah, 11 people were killed when their bus was hit by a roadside bomb, officials said.   Also on Tuesday, unknown attackers seized 22 people from vehicles on a highway linking Kabul and Gardez, a key city in the eastern province of Paktia.

"In a report published in the Atlantic, four men have accused director Bryan Singer of sexually assaulting them while they were underage. The alleged assaults took place in California between 1997 and 1999. Singer is the credited director of Bohemian Rhapsody and is known for directing films like X-Men, X2, and The Usual Suspects. The Atlantic’s report details the Hollywood circles Singer was reportedly part of during the late ’90s, the boys he met and parties he threw during that time period, the allegations of sexual assault of underage boys, and an alleged pattern of abuse that wrecked the accusers’ lives. It was written by Alex French and Maximillian Potter — a writer at large and editor at large for Esquire, respectively — who say they spent 12 months reporting the story and spoke to more than 50 sources about the allegations. Singer’s lawyer Andrew Brettler denied the allegations against his client, stating to French and Potter that Singer has never been arrested or convicted of any crime and that he categorically denies ever having sex with, or a preference for, underage men. Singer, through his lawyer, told Vox the story is a “homophobic smear piece [that] has been conveniently timed to take advantage of [Bohemian Rhapsody’s] success” and that it was written by “a homophobic journalist who has a bizarre obsession with me dating back to 1997.” French and Potter tell the stories of four men who had previously never spoken publicly about their allegations against Singer. One of those men is Victor Valdovinos, who told French and Potter that when he was 13, he worked as an extra on Singer’s 1998 film Apt Pupil. Valdovinos says that during a day of filming a locker room scene that required partial nudity, Singer molested him multiple times. Per the Atlantic: According to Valdovinos, Singer reached through the towel flaps and “grabbed my genitals and started masturbating it.” The director also “rubbed his front part on me,” Valdovinos alleges. “He did it all with this smile.” Valdovinos says that Singer told him, “You’re so good-looking … I really want to work with you … I have a nice Ferrari … I’m going to take care of you.” “I was frozen. Speechless,” Valdovinos continues. “He came back to where I was in the locker room throughout the day to molest me.” The other three men in the story were given pseudonyms for fear of retaliation. One of those men, identified as “Andy,” says he was 15 when he met Singer through Marc Collins-Rector, a purported friend of Singer’s and a convicted sex offender. Andy told French and Potter that he and Singer had sex the first night they met, and multiple times after: “I just remember how loud the moaning was. I remember thinking, God, there’s a big group of people downstairs hanging out in the living room, and they can probably hear him. That bothered me, so I stuck my hand over his mouth or in his mouth just to stop it. When we went downstairs, it was really awkward. I just acted like it was no big thing.” Another man, identified as “Ben,” told the writers he met Singer at one of Singer’s parties. Ben said he was 17 or 18 when Singer coerced him to perform oral sex on him. “He would stick his hands down your pants without your consent,” Ben told French and Potter. “He was predatory in that he would ply people with alcohol and drugs and then have sex with them.” Ben also said “it wasn’t a hold-you-down-and-rape-you situation.” The fourth man, identified as “Eric,” alleges that he and Singer had sex when Eric was 17, and that he witnessed a system in which young boys were brought to Singer and his friends to curry favor. “If you weren’t young and cute enough to be their boy, you could still ingratiate yourself by bringing boys to them,” Eric said. These are not the first allegations of sexual misconduct that have surfaced against Singer. In 2014, two men filed lawsuits against Singer accusing him of sexually assaulting them while they were underage. Those lawsuits were later dismissed. Then in 2017, Singer denied accusations by Cesar Sanchez-Guzman, a 31-year-old man from Washington, who filed a lawsuit saying that Singer raped him when he was 17, on a yacht sailing from Lake Union to Lake Washington in Seattle. And in October 2018, Singer posted a message on Instagram warning of a “negative article” from Esquire about him and implied that it was a publicity-seeking opportunity timed to the release of Bohemian Rhapsody, which came out on November 2. A post shared by Bryan Singer (@bryanjaysinger) on Oct 15, 2018 at 2:06am PDT According to the Hollywood Reporter, Singer was fired from the project in December 2017, a few weeks before filming ended, after he clashed with star Rami Malek and disappeared from the set. Singer said his absence was due to wanting to care for a sick parent. Because of Directors Guild of America rules, only one director or team can be credited for directing a film, and Singer remains the sole credited director for Bohemian Rhapsody. It appears that Singer’s October Instagram post may have been referencing Potter and French, who are both named on Esquire’s masthead. Though Potter and French originally reported the story for Esquire, it was later brought to the Atlantic, where, according to a spokesperson for the magazine, it went through the publication’s legal vetting and fact-checking process. Singer, in a statement made through his lawyer, disparaged the piece, calling into question the credibility of the writers, accusers, and editors: The last time I posted about this subject, Esquire magazine was preparing to publish an article written by a homophobic journalist who has a bizarre obsession with me dating back to 1997. After careful fact-checking and, in consideration of the lack of credible sources, Esquire chose not to publish this piece of vendetta journalism. That didn’t stop this writer from selling it to The Atlantic. It’s sad that The Atlantic would stoop to this low standard of journalistic integrity. Again, I am forced to reiterate that this story rehashes claims from bogus lawsuits filed by a disreputable cast of individuals willing to lie for money or attention. And it is no surprise that, with Bohemian Rhapsody being an award-winning hit, this homophobic smear piece has been conveniently timed to take advantage of its success. The writers of the piece responded, and said that the piece was fact-checked at Esquire but then Hearst executives killed the article. The move then let them publish at The Atlantic: Statement from reporters Maximillian Potter and Alex French on investigation of Bryan Singer published in @TheAtlantic: pic.twitter.com/iouvNZGQtz Singer has not been involved in promoting Bohemian Rhapsody on the awards circuit. The movie was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture on January 22, and its star Malek was nominated for Best Actor. It previously won Best Drama at the Golden Globes. Also on January 22, Malek distanced himself from Singer, telling People that he “was not aware of” any allegations against Singer before working on Bohemian Rhapsody. Singer is still slated to direct an upcoming Red Sonja remake.

"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian farm exports may benefit from rising trade tensions between the United States and China, an official from Mato Grosso state, Brazil’s largest grain growing region, said in an interview on Friday.  “Signs of growing tensions between the United States and China may be a good opportunity for Brazil given our prowess to produce grains like soy and corn,” said Carlos Favaro, Mato Grosso vice governor. He added Brazil can expand commercial ties with China, noting such bonds have been steadily growing in recent years as China has invested heavily in Brazil’s agribusiness sector and infrastructure projects.

"On the latest episode of Pivot, Recode’s Kara Swisher traded in Scott Galloway for a guest co-host: Crooked Media’s Jon Lovett, the co-host of Pod Save America and host of Lovett or Leave It. They talked about everything from Trump’s shutdown to Netflix’s Bird Box, and why the newly Democratic-controlled House of Representatives probably won’t make a move to regulate tech giants like Facebook. “I think if you were to ask a bunch of Democrats off the record, like do you think these companies should be regulated, they’d all say yes,” Lovett said. “How many of them want to make it happen? How many of them really want to devote their resources and attention to it? “You look at what animates Democratic voters, you look at what animates Democratic politicians, it’s health care, it’s increasingly climate. It is wages and economic issues, it’s issues around reproductive freedom and criminal justice reform and inequality,” he added. “But regulating Mark Zuckerberg, right now ... There’s a lot of press releases and hand-wringing but you don’t really hear a big coherent case.” You can listen to Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway wherever you get your podcasts — including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast. Below, we’ve shared a full transcript of Kara’s conversation with Jon. Kara Swisher: Hi everyone. This is Pivot from the Vox Media Podcast Network. I’m Kara Swisher, welcome to Pivot 2019. This week, Scott Galloway is out and my friend Jon Lovett from Crooked Media is here. Hello, Jon. Jon Lovett: Hello, Kara. You’re stepping into the co-host chair. Jon hosts a number of his own fantastic podcasts including Pod Save America and ... Lovett or Leave It. Exactly. And we’re here at their headquarters in Los Angeles, at the Crooked Media headquarters, and I’m having a great time and I appreciate you doing this for me. Thanks for coming. Look, people clamor for ... You and I. For us to be together. Because we have such a spark, right? We have such a spark. It’s electric. It’s electric right now. You don’t know what’s going on in the studio right now. But, thank you for the ultimate podcast crossover episode. So, I sort of gave you an idea of what we do here on Pivot, but it’s just exactly talking about the big story shake-downs. Then we talk about predictions and wins and fails of the week and I just, you’re so opinionated. I think you can agree with me on that one. Sure. That you will have lots of opinions. There’s so much in the news now that you can discuss. We’re going to focus obviously on political stuff, but whatever you want to talk about. And so, let’s do first the big story breakdown. Obviously the government shutdown for you all, is that correct, and stuff like that. I want to pivot it towards tech legislation, because I think it’s never going to happen now because they can’t even decide on lunch in Washington. Yeah. So, talk about that big story. The Democrats taking over the house, Nancy Pelosi was elected speaker of the House again. Yes. Tell us where we are with this big story. So, let’s talk about the shutdown. Okay. You know, Donald Trump has, over the past two years, kind of had a pattern — whether it’s with DACA and the DREAMers, the Paris Climate Accords, the Iran deal, now this shutdown, several other issues — he knows instinctively that his comfort with cruelty, with damage, gives him leverage. He does know that. However, he doesn’t ever seem to have the discipline or follow-through to say, “Okay, I will threaten to deport children who did nothing wrong and were brought here by their parents.” Right. To get a deal. But then, when that deal is put on the table, when Democrats say, “You know what? If you’ll protect DREAMers and come to the table on immigration, we’ll give you money for border security.” He walks away. It’s never good enough. He talks about renegotiating deals. NAFTA, right? He threatens to pull out of NAFTA, they make some cosmetic changes to NAFTA. Now with this shutdown, he sits down in the Oval Office with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and says, “I’m going to shut the government down over border security.” Over the wall. Over the wall. Or steel slats or whatever. Over steel slats. “I’m the one that’s going to do it. You want open borders, I want the wall. Call me Mr. Shutdown. I’m king shutdown, shutdown man.” Government shuts down. Well, what’s the plan? Because you know, the Senate passed on a bipartisan basis by a voice vote, which basically means 100 percent of the Senators got behind a bipartisan deal that included much less funding for border security. He then makes this threat. Paul Ryan, in one of his last acts, perfect last act for him, goes along with it. Right. Twizzling Paul Ryan, goes along with this ... the word is fakakta. It’s a fakakta plan. And the government has been shut down. I am very glad that Paul Ryan left the government as a capitulating supplicant to Donald Trump while the government was shutdown, while the debt hit record levels, right? Every single thing Paul Ryan claimed to care about. And the stock market. And the stock market took a huge hit. Every single thing that Paul Ryan claims to have cared about and been a leader on was damaged by his time. Good-bye, Paul. Good-bye. Don’t let the door hit you. Right. You know what? Let it hit you ... on your way to the gym. Let the door hit you on the way out. We got that. Buns of steel, let the door hit you. Listen, for two years, in my mind I had just been waiting for the moment where Nancy Pelosi takes the gavel from Paul Ryan’s fucking hands and today, it happened. So, you look at Donald Trump ... Did he give it to her? No, because he’s not in Congress anymore. Kevin McCarthy handed it over, which is much less satisfying, let’s be honest about it. That guy. Look at what Donald Trump did in the intervening time between an old Congress and a new Congress. He shut the government down over border security. He had two years of unified Congress, couldn’t get this kind of thing through. Nancy Pelosi just took the gavel. Did it get easier to get your money? Of course not. Of course not, especially because we know that the Senate already passed a bipartisan bill that the House can now pass a version of. So, he basically does what he does. What Donald Trump does, he shoots the hostage, now the hostage is lying on the ground bleeding. He doesn’t have a plan for how to get his ransom. So, that’s where we are right now. I don’t think anyone really knows how it’s going to shake out. Donald Trump is dug in but ... So, what’s going to happen? What is from you guys, you guys talk about this a lot on Pod Save America and Lovett or Leave It. What’s going to happen then? I don’t know. I don’t have a prediction. What has happened over the past few years is there’s a lot of bluster around shutdowns, about shutdowns going on forever and how you’ll be blamed and I won’t be blamed. But Donald Trump went into this shutdown taking the blame for it. In the end, they choose to give in in some way. Right. It’s a hard thing to know how this actually shakes out, what kind of fig leaf Donald Trump will claim in order to reopen the government. I don’t really know, but it certainly doesn’t end with Nancy Pelosi’s, one of her first acts as Democratic Speaker, giving Donald Trump his $5 billion unless there’s some new big deal on immigration — which, again, feels very unlikely because, again, that deal was killed by Donald Trump before. So, they can’t do anything. One of the things that we’ve been talking a lot about this year on Pivot is the idea of tech legislation, privacy legislation, any legislation making these giant platforms more accountable. That seems impossible at this point, right? I mean, yeah. Look, they can’t seem to agree on basic functioning of the government. There’s not a bipartisan basis for that legislation right now. Republicans control the Senate. Even Democratic Senators, if I’m being honest, there’s not many of them have taken up the mantel. You know, it’s something ... Senator Warner. Warner, of course, has been a leader about this and said interesting things about it. But even he has been, you know, he has taken his time in reaching the point of saying that these companies need more regulation. People like Brian Schatz who are really smart messengers and are really smart about thinking through what the next Democratic position should be has been talking about this more. But ultimately, the place that I’m interested in this debate taking place is the 2020 field and how this plays out amongst Democrats, because not only is a lot of this dependent on electing a Democratic president especially when we don’t have control of the Senate, that is also where a lot of the most important policy debates move forward, is in Democratic primaries. That’s what we saw in health care. I think that’s this time what we’ll see on tech, on monopoly, that I think ... Do you think that is going to be a big issue or has tech kind of gotten out of, gotten away from paying the price for this? Because Nancy, I had talked to Nancy Pelosi and she talked about this internet bill of rights and Democrats now are much tougher on tech, right? They’ve shifted. They were the best friends of tech and then they moved away from it. Yeah, I think it’s a really good question. I think this is one of those places where you see the cost of Democratic leadership, Congressional leadership, generally being older. They’re not as fluent in this conversation. I also think it’s taking time for this idea to kind of move through the system. I think if you were to ask a bunch of Democrats off the record, like do you think these companies should be regulated, they’d all say yes. How many of them want to make it happen? How many of them really want to devote their resources and attention to it? It’s not been ... When there’s so many other things. When there’s so many other things. I mean, you look at what animates Democratic voters, you look at what animates Democratic politicians, it’s health care, it’s increasingly climate. It is wages and economic issues, it’s issues around reproductive freedom and criminal justice reform and inequality. But regulating Mark Zuckerberg, right now, it does feel like a lot of the patter ... Regulating Mark Zuckerberg. That sounds terrible. Sound like the name of your book. Yes. There’s a lot of press releases and hand-wringing but you don’t really hear a big coherent case for here’s what the future of regulation on these issues ... Right, No. I agree. It’s going to happen in the states, like Gavin Newsom and California and places ... even if it does happen, because there’s so many other issues. Yeah, I also think it’s tied into a larger, much harder conversation about corporate power generally and corporate power inside of the Democratic party. And I think that’s partly why I’ve looked to the 2020 field as a place to have this debate, is I think the need to rein in Facebook, the need to rein in the monopolistic power that a lot of these companies have is going to be part of a larger conversation about the influence of money in politics, about the concentration of wealth, about corporate consolidation. And you know, Elizabeth Warren, that’s part of her ... Yeah, just announced. I was going to ask about that, enters the presidential race. Yeah. She enters the presidential race. You know, even Nancy Pelosi, her speech today taking the speakership talked about the concentration of wealth. So I think that’s going to be, I hope ... And guess where the wealth is. And I hope one of the big ... I think corporate power and corporate concentration, as it applies to tech companies, as it applies to Amazon, as it applies to banks, as it applies to telecom, as it applies to all these different industries, is to me the sleeper issue. It’s not that it’s not being talked about, but it is to me the place where Democrats can really say, “This is now not a part of our program, but a centerpiece of how we talk about ...” Will they turn on tech? I mean, they seem to be, Cory Booker does, you know, some of them are really starting to beyond ... Yeah, I don’t think it’s necessarily about turning on tech. I think it’s about saying, “Well, hold on a second.” You know, you guys have been ... the tech companies have been so unwilling to even define what they are, to avoid the conversation about where they fit and their power. They’re reluctant to talk about it, while at the same time exploiting it, building businesses off it, building great wealth off of it. So, I don’t think it’s about turning on tech. I think what you will see is what you always see around these issues. I think you will see some Democrats still adhere to a ’90s way of talking about these issues that everybody can win. Absolutely. Then, I think you will see some further to the left be more strident, or at least more zero sum in these conversations. Right. “Let’s get rid of these powers.” Yeah, we have to attack these, these have to be broken up. These should be heavily regulated. They’re greedy, they’re corrupting our democracy. All of which I think has a lot of truth to it. And then I think you will see what happens with Democratic politicians, you will see a more moderate center-left position that becomes the kind of cohesive position that says it’s not about ... you will see ... Amazon has done a lot of good for people, right? They’ll say that. This is what their message will be like. Consumer harm is the issue, right? Right. The harm in saying like, can we have a system in which these companies are able to innovate and thrive and lead the world right? As one of America’s most important and powerful sectors, while preventing some of the consequences of their worst behavior. And I think that is a very reasonable question. That to me is where the debate will ultimately lie. They also will have enormous power, Netflix taking down the episode about Saudi Arabia about journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi. Yeah. And these are some of the hardest ... They just did that. They just did it. But these are some of the hardest questions we face as a culture, right? Even dividing it into a tech conversation. You know, Netflix is going to take a lot of heat for this, but companies like Warner Bros. are deciding whether or not to include scenes in films based on what a Chinese censor would say. Well, okay. So, now Chinese censors are dictating what appears in America. Right. You know, this is a very specific example. There is a ... Martin Scorsese made a movie about Tibet. You can’t get it. Right. Because ... and that’s an old problem. We’ve been dealing with censorship around multimedia, about multinational companies and the content they create for a very long time. There’s just a new manifestation of it. And it’s more important now, in part because these companies are so much bigger, so much ... have so much control. Pervasive. They’re pervasive. So, it becomes a big conversation. But it’s a conversation we’ve had for a very long time. Right. But they are, well, you know ... Kundun. That’s the movie. Kundun. That’s right. But you know, they’ve weaponized and amplified in a way that is way beyond anything else. Well, they ... I think it’s very hard. I’ve watched you talk to Mark Zuckerberg and try desperately to get to him to lower the fucking shield that he’s built. Well, it’s hard to reprogram Data, but go ahead. It’s just, I mean ... just three inches of just solid concrete between him and you. But as you chip, chip, chip, I think the thing that is true is that they did not think enough about downside risk. No, never. Never. No. No, connecting people is good. Therefore, connecting people is good. And well, guess what? People are people. And some of them are fucking terrible. Yeah, I couldn’t get him to answer on the damages. No. You couldn’t even get him to talk about how he feels about it. No, I couldn’t. Six times. I did try to get him to fire himself. Here’s the thing. Upton Sinclair: You can’t convince somebody of something their livelihood depends on not believing. That was so high-minded, Jon. Pretty good. Upton Sinclair? Go ahead. Upton Sinclair. It’s one of my favorite lines because ... Okay. It’s a very good line. There are many conclusions Facebook can reach. The one conclusion it can’t reach is that it’s doing more harm than good. It’s not possible. Right. Right? Every technology company should have a red button somewhere in the headquarters where if they realize they’ve caused more societal harm than they expected and done more harm than good, they press the button and the company dissolves instantly. That’s it. Just a big, red button in the center of the headquarters. You need two keys to unlock it, maybe a code, maybe a two-factor. Maybe one of those Unikeys, right? Just to unlock the fucking thing. But then, push comes to shove, you know what? “Guys, it’s mostly Nazis now. Push the button.” Yeah, yeah. “It’s mostly Nazis.” “We looked, we crunched the numbers, and it’s robots and Nazis. Press the button.” It’s Nazis and ... That is a societal good! We’re getting to that. That’s a good. That is a good. You know, one of the things I’ve said is we have to like — I’ve said this recently a lot — is we have to ... they should imagine every product they make as an episode of Black Mirror. Sure. What’s the ... except not San Junipero, that one, because that’s a nice one, but all the bad ones. Absolutely. Then they shouldn’t make it if they can think of a really good episode. Right, because so far our track record is Black Mirror is just the news from four years from now. Exactly. All right. Jon, red button. I love this idea. We’re here with Jon Lovett. We’re at the headquarters of Crooked Media. And we’re loosening up. We’re loosening up. We’re starting to drink and stuff like that. We’re going to take a quick break, but stay with us. We’re going to go into wins and fails of the week when we get back with Jon Lovett. [ad] Now, back to the show. How did I read those, Jon? How did I? You did great. Did I do great? And was there anything that you’d emphasize more? QuickBooks! I think you could have brought a little more heart to it. Let’s just be honest. I don’t think you’re going to ... I don’t know if you saw Roma. I don’t think you’re going to ... I saw Roma. So I think she did a better job in her performance than you did. Oh, thank you, thank you. In yours. Thank you. But she was transcendent. She was transcendent. You were fine. Okay, thanks. I’m not up to your Roma standards? You’re not. Oh, man, that was a good movie, wasn’t it? Why didn’t they pick up the dog poop? Why didn’t they pick up the dog poop? Why didn’t they pick up the dog poop? Just pick it up. I mean, seriously. I was like, just pick it up. It’s so funny that that’s your takeaway from the film. I literally got obsessed with it. It was making me crazy. It was crazy. It was making me crazy. And then they drove over it, I’m like, “What are you doing?” Stepped in it, drove over it. Stepped in it, drove in it. It’s a metaphor, probably. I know, exactly. Anyway, in any case, let’s move on. So we have a segment that, we’re going to talk about some wins and fails of the week. And one of them, to me, was the women in India forming the 385-mile human chain for gender equality. And then there was a fail that I thought ... men accused of sexual harassment trying to make comebacks, like Louis CK and Kevin Spacey, making some creepy attempts to get behind the microphone. What do you think? Give me some of your wins and fails. I would say ... Look, I think Nancy Pelosi becoming Speaker of the House is one of the most important wins that we will have. Oh, of course, Nancy Pelosi. Go ahead. Yes, explain. Yeah. Not just because ... So look, before this election ... I’m a partisan, but I believe that Democrats winning the House was one of the most important steps we could take as a country to protect ourselves. Right. Mm-hmm. And the cost of losing, I think, would have been cataclysmic. So we avoided a truly horrific outcome in which people felt really dispirited. And we would have learned something quite horrific, which is, there wasn’t a price for Donald Trump’s terrible behavior or Paul Ryan’s capitulation to him. So that in and of itself was valuable. But Nancy Pelosi — I think the same thing about Elizabeth Warren — Nancy Pelosi, if she were a man, she would be considered one of the great leaders in modern political history. This is correct. I like how you’re knitting this together. Yeah, and I think she would be, and I think she will be. I think increasingly she is, in part because people are pointing this out, that saying that Paul Ryan was a young gun, intellectual leader, cover of magazines, even though it was mostly a fraud. Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, grinding away for decades, retakes the speakership. And by the way, one of the most successful speakers. I mean, those first two years of the Obama administration are one of the most productive legislative periods in modern history, right? Rivaling ... Not rival ... In the pantheon of periods of time of progress with FDR and Lyndon Johnson, have a lot of things getting done in a period of great crisis. Now, she retakes that gavel at a little time of incredible importance in which we need Democrats to stick together. We need a strong leader, and we have that. I think that’s really, really important. I would say one of the big fails of this week has been this conversation around likability around Elizabeth Warren. Right. Echoing the old Hillary Clinton one. Right. And as people have pointed out, a lot of people who are currently saying Elizabeth Warren is unlikable, said that she was the likable alternative to Hillary Clinton. Isn’t it amazing how unlikable a woman becomes once she decides to go for the big prize? Right. Right. But in the same way that Nancy Pelosi isn’t given the credit she’s due, to me, it’s easy to have a conversation about how the term “likability” is sexist. And it is. It’s easy to say, “That’s wrong.” But what’s harder to talk about is what’s missing. Right. And Elizabeth Warren, I watched her announcement video, and it is excellent. It is also what she has been talking about for her entire career. Forever. Mm-hmm. Before she was in the Senate, she was a professor. She is the one who came up with this idea for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mm-hmm. That originally she was going to lead but couldn’t get confirmed for it. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. But she has been the ... She, I think, more than anyone else you could point to and say, this is the intellectual leader of democratic politics. And she doesn’t get called back. If she were a man, she would right now be the natural frontrunner, the unalloyed frontrunner in Democratic politics. She has been the intellectual leader. She is a charismatic politician. She’s incredibly smart in how she talks about issues. She has been a consistent ... She’s been ahead of the curve in terms of talking about things like corporate power, talking about what’s been happening to the middle class. It’s interesting. She’s sort of like that character on Homeland who was the president who became ... You know what I mean? She rubs people the wrong way. I don’t watch soap operas. Okay. It’s enjoyable. I like Claire Danes, and she can do anything she wants. In any case, what do you watch? I watch all kinds of things. What’s your favorite show right now? Listen, I enjoyed Homecoming. I’m watching The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Oh yes. It’s marvelous, isn’t it? It’s a delight. It’s delightful. It’s a delight. It’s a delight. All right, I’m going to get back to Elizabeth Warren. We had her at the Code Conference several years ago. And I have never gotten such negative feedback from men in my life. I have to tell you, it was fascinating. It was as if she went onstage and threw shit at them. It was amazing. It was sort of way out-sized, her appearance. And it was really interesting to me. What do you think that is? I’ve no idea, but it was remarkable. It was remarkable. I thought she was quite good, and very articulate about it. I don’t know if it was her shoes? I don’t know what bothered them. Something got under them and worked their last nerve with her. And it was sort of like, “Whoa,” that was fascinating. Yeah. I think she was a lady. Yeah. Also, she’s got opinions. She’s a lady with opinions. I think that’s really what it was. Unabashedly. And strong opinions. Unabashedly. And she tsk-tsked them, for sure, about wealth and power, the same thing as your corporate wealth and power, and rich people don’t like being told they’re awful, who think they’re great. Right. And they certainly don’t ... Coming from someone who’s not going to preface it by saying how sorry they are to have the opinion. Right, exactly. It was interesting. I was really like ... It was a real moment for me at the event. Yeah. I mean, look, this is ... I think a lot of the defenders of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy make this similar argument, which is, every time you say that she was uniquely ill-suited, you fail to account for the ways in which a sexist system has spent a very long time making her ill-suited in the way that you’re describing. Right. And I think that there is a lot of truth to that. You also see on the flip side, we just elected 89 women to serve in the Congress as Democrats. Right. I thought we only elected Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She gets a lot of attention. It was her and ... No, I know, I know that. 88 others. I know you know, I know you know. I like her squad. I like everything. Speaking of attacks. Oh man, she gets ... They are going through her yearbook and putting these things out there as if they are criticism. She danced in college. She went by a nickname. And also they were saying, oh, she didn’t go to school in the Bronx. She talks about how she took a long trip to go to a better school. Right. Right. And how she learned from her home in the Bronx to this nicer neighborhood. Right. The differences of wealth, she’s talked about it. Right. The sexist attacks on AOC are incredible. You know what’s astonishing? She’s really good at whacking them back. She is. She is. I literally have never seen someone as good at Twitter except for Trump, who I think is very good at Twitter, whether you like him or not. He’s good at it. I agree. She’s fantastic. Her chopping onions and talking about wealth was riveting. It’s also one thing, to your point, oh, I didn’t realize other women were elected. Right. Right? She is someone who has, because of her own charisma, because of conservative attacks, because of how she kind of surprised people by winning in this primary against a prominent Democrat, has been given a pretty out-sized platform. Yeah. And she’s going to use it. Right. And she’s using it really well. Yeah. And to champion things she cares about. It’s such a funny thing. It’s like, “Oh, why is AOC getting all this attention?” That’s not the question. She has it. And how is she using it? Right. She’s spending it really fucking well. Right, yeah. She’s holding people accountable on the green new deal, she’s advocating for things she cares about, she’s pushing back on right-wing attacks on her in a really sort of charming and classy way. Charming. Right, yeah. And an effective way. So, she didn’t decide to become someone who receives all this attention. A culture around her for reasons good and bad decided that. Mm-hmm. But good. Yeah. She’s using it. Yeah, she does use it really well. She’s really fascinating. It’s interesting, we’ll see how Nancy Pelosi uses the medium. She’s not real good on Twitter and stuff like that. She’s just not. Although, she did push back on the coat thing, which was a meme online. Her whole weird coat obsession, which I’m like, “It’s a coat.” And she did actually talk about it, but it was interesting how that became something. Yeah. Well, I’m glad she had that moment with Trump. Yeah. Oh no, the moment was great. Fantastic. The coat was ridiculous. The obsession of her coat she wore outside. That became the talking point. She looked good in the coat. She looked good in the coat, Jon. But really, it’s a coat. I’m not sitting here talking ... You’re the one bringing up the coat. She wore ... You can’t stop talking about it. I’m just saying. But I’m saying ... Why are you obsessed with Nancy Pelosi’s coat? Because they were discussing the coat versus what she did in there, more than what Schumer did in there. And she did the same thing. That’s my ... She’s better than Schumer. That’s right. She was quite good. And the coat became the meme, the online meme and all. So getting to that, and then I want to go to predictions, how do you look at social media and its impact in the next, going forward? Because obviously negative for the last one, and how they ... The Russian thing was a real bummer. So we crunched the numbers. Right. Bad. Bad. Bad. I don’t know. It’s a really hard question. I don’t really ... We’re out of the prediction business, but as individuals, we have to choose how we use these platforms. And I think that there’s two direct ... There’s offense and defense. On offense, I think we each choose the kind of person we are online. And I think there’s a lot of very good people who have chosen to be very ugly versions of themselves online. And I like to think that the more time we spend, the more we adapt, the more we learn, the better people will do. I think that’s wishful thinking. But I do think as individuals ... I think there’s a lot of people out there that would look back on their tweets and posts and conduct online since they started using Twitter and say ... Let’s say they took all of my tweets and made an artificially intelligent version of me. Right. Mm-hmm. Would I like that person? Right. Would I like the version of me? Do you? I like you. Listen, I think I’m the rare exception. I’m a Twitter delight. But I think for the most part we would say we are more strident, meaner, less vulnerable, less honest. We’re more narcissistic, we’re more like Trump. That’s why Trump’s good at Twitter. Right. We are ostensibly tough, but also quite weak when we’re on Twitter, right? That’s how we are. We’re extremely vulnerable to injury while projecting a kind of imperviousness. So I think that’s the offense. And there’s defense, which is how we each use it. And I take myself off now. I took myself off Twitter for this break. I occasionally went back on to search for my name. You’re very good. Just to do it, look at my mentions, because I’m human and there’s still blood in my veins. But these are tools. And I don’t think that they were developed maliciously. I think that there were truly good intentions behind Twitter. I think there are truly good intentions behind Facebook. However, these things have adapted to basically pornify our minds, right? Pornify. To reduce ideas. In the same way that McDonald’s is the porn of food, Twitter is the porn of information. Oh. It is bite-size. It gives you that little bit of feedback. Makes you feel bad, dirty. It’s that it feeds your immediate needs while over time making you feel less and less value. That is very wise thinking. Less and less whole. What about the impact on politics? How do you think politicians are looking at it for the next cycles? It’s sort of wobbly during the midterms. Yes. But it didn’t break anything. So I think there’s, again, the offensive/defensive. On offense, I would like to see more politicians just hold the phone themselves, use it the way Beto O’Rourke does. Use it the way, actually, Elizabeth Warren sometimes does, where you just kind of feel like you’re hearing from them. Use it the way AOC does. Mm-hmm. Use it the way Adam Schiff ... Adam Schiff is ... Chris Murphy and others do where you just feel like you’re hearing from them. Yeah. Honestly, Chuck Grassley at times. Mm-hmm. He’s good. He’s good. Just uses it. Chuck Grassley is good. It’s not a medium for your press releases. Conway’s good. Yeah. George Conway is fantastic on Twitter. Fantastic. Fantastic. I have a man crush on him on Twitter. I think that that’s a mistake. I know it is, but I can’t help myself. He’s very clever. Okay. All right. Okay. We’ll talk about that after. Okay. We’ll work through that. All right. Why is it a problem? You tell me right now. Because he’s the font of all evil on the planet and ... I think that having vaguely okay opinions while being married to Kellyanne Conway is not a badge of honor. I see. Right. Okay. Fair point. So, in terms of how they use it defensively, I think that there’s this big question. And the question is, how much does the Twitter conversation reflect the world? Mm-hmm. And we just don’t know. Right. You don’t know. That is a really good point. That is a really good point. It certainly is not analogous. Feels like it. And especially because all the reporters are on it and all the media is on it. Twitter definitely reflects the conversation reporters have. It definitely reflects the conversations politicians and democratic activists and the most devoted hard-core observers of politics, the right wing and left wing, center, all of it. That is a real conversation. Except, obviously, not as honest, not as open, not as vulnerable, not as fair, not as nice, fine. Which is by the way, you’re just saying that, that sucks, right? Mm-hmm. It’s just an uglier version of a real conversation. Now, how does it reflect what real people think? What their experience of politics are? People out in the world who aren’t devoted to politics 24/7? We just don’t know. We don’t know how angry most people who watch CNN are about various panels and how they behave. We don’t know what ... I can tell you, my kids don’t care. And he’s going to be voting in the next election too. It’s so funny too, because this is a moment of so much passion and activism and anger for good and for ill online. But to me, sometimes I think when we look back, if things get worse, if we look back at this moment, what we will actually realize was an omen was actually how little people care. The government shut down. There are 800,000 furloughed people, most of whom are not getting paid by the government. And yeah, there’s online outrage but we’ve kind of gotten to the point where we just sort of whistle past the graveyard. Yeah, I agree, I agree. So it’s this crazy thing where, on the one hand, there’s a frenetic, endless, angry, elevated ... You know what it is, it’s like on Twitter, it’s the movie Gravity, but in real life it’s Roma. You know, same director. Same director. Difference experience. Yeah, bad movie the first one. Okay. Okay, wait, you liked it? What are you talking about? She came down from space by a happenstance? Come on. That’s your summary of ... Yes. That’s your summary of Gravity. Came down from space by happenstance. What is your summary? The human spirit! Oh my god. Using ingenuity and zeal to triumph over ... You probably liked Bird Box, right? No, I do not like Bird Box. Okay. Bird Box is the greatest scam Netflix has ever ... 45 million people watched. 45 million people. Here’s a great example of why these companies are a bit too powerful. They’re in every house, all right, and they went into everybody’s algorithm and they said, “I don’t care what you like, I don’t care if you like baking, I don’t care if you like Bosch,” not Bosch, what’s that show, Kosh? Kosh, I don’t know. Kosh, Bosch? “I don’t care if you like old episodes of the Big Bang Theory or Frasier.” West Wing. “You are going to fucking watch Bird Box.” You sit there and you watch Bird Box. Hey, hey, did you open Netflix? Guess what? Bird Box. Then they brag about the fact that 45 million people ... They basically went into every American home and turned it on. Wow, you know what? I bet like other companies, why didn’t we think of that? Why didn’t HBO think to go into everybody’s house and turn on ... Why didn’t it go into everybody’s house and just turn on Game of Thrones? Well, yeah, a lot of people will fucking watch it. Unbelievable! Did you watch it? Did you watch it? Yeah, of course I watched it! Netflix made me watch it. I never heard of Bird Box. I’m sitting ... You live in Los Angeles! There’s a poster of Bird Box everywhere. Which is the equivalent of them turning it on in my car. Exactly. I’m sitting at home, minding my own business, living my life, it’s holiday break, I open up Netflix. And? And then Bird Box pops up and I think, “Sandra Bullock in a movie with a blindfold. It seems like action, I’m in!” I watched Bird Box before I ever even heard of the thing. That’s how they got me. That’s funny. So was it good? I didn’t watch it. It’s not good. It’s a very bad movie. It’s very bad? It’s a mess. Is it bad/good, good/bad? Whatever. It’s almost bad/good. It is a reminder that part of Netflix’s business model is traveling around Hollywood with a vacuum cleaner and just sucking up the things that hit the ground. Oh, okay. That’s another episode. Thank you for that piece ... Have you sold a show to them yet? Because everyone seems to have. I don’t know, I have to put some space between when this comes out and my next meeting over there. Over there. All right, so I’m going to ask for a prediction, Jon. Or your resolution for the year. I want a prediction. Is it Mitt Romney’s running for ... lost his mind or what? What is your prediction? I will make one. That was crazy online, Mitt Romney. Bird Box and Mitt. Yes, man, Mitt Romney. I think that ... He tries, right? They try, like George, vaguely trying to like ... Mitt Romney. There’s always what he says and there’s always why he’s saying it and it’s never the same. Okay, explain it to the people then. Well, I don’t know. Look, I don’t want to be, on the one hand, I am very sick of Republicans, even Republicans with some conscience, speaking out against Trump without using their power effectively to stop him. That’s what I think you can say about Ben Sasse, that’s what you could say about Jeff Flake, that’s what you could say about Bob Corker and many others. They were never willing to truly use their power as senators. It’s almost as if that ... I think one of the kind of surreal aspects of our current political environment is there is the sense that people are kind of afraid of power. Mm-hmm. As if they don’t really deserve it and don’t really have it when all you have to do ... That’s like Mark Zuckerberg. I talked about that with him, he pushes away power that he has. There’s this kind of sense that, “Oh, power’s for history, it’s not for me.” No, you’re in it, this is the fight, this is the moment. You have it, you’re in the fight, you either use it or you lose it. And they all chose not to use it. What Romney did that is distinct is he set down a marker before he took office in a way he did not have to. I think that there is value to that. Now, I’m very interested to see if he follows through with it. Yeah, or else he’s at dinner at the White House. Sure. And Mitt Romney’s track record is not one in which you find political courage on display. And keep in mind, he is part of the reason Donald Trump was elevated. He accepted his endorsement even though he was a birther, etc., etc., etc. I don’t begrudge him for meeting with him at that creepy Trump International dinner because ... Yeah, that was creepy. I think especially right then, it’s like ... Okay, a lot of people did. A lot of people did take a shot. I actually don’t begrudge him that. But his behavior before and since has not been that exemplary, he accepted Donald Trump’s endorsement, he’s played his cards I think very politically. But let’s see what he does. The thing that makes me least enthusiastic is he said that — a classic line, which is, “I will support Donald Trump’s policies when I agree with them and I will not support them when I don’t.” Like that’s the standard? Hold on a second. Well, look, I had a friend and sometimes he brought me dinner of food I like and sometimes he used my vacuum cleaner without permission, I don’t know, making up a scenario. I’d be like, “You know what? Thank you for bringing me the dinner, it bothers me that you use the vacuum cleaner but you’re still my friend. I will support you when you support me and we will go our different ways.” But if I had a friend who did nice things for me once in a while but then also randomly punched people on the street, or commit an act of violence or set cars on fire, I wouldn’t be this thing of, no, obviously I support my friend when he does nice things but I don’t support him when he ... No, hold on, you’re a fucking prick. Yeah, yeah, you gotta get rid of that. This is idea of like... They won’t make choices. Not making choices is what they won’t do. You have to put the things you care about on the line to stop Donald Trump. If you’re gonna go along with him when he supports the judges you like or policies you like and not when he doesn’t, you’re actually refusing to use the leverage you have. That’s what Bob Corker did, that’s what Flake did. You’re not using your leverage. So Mitt Romney, all right, use your leverage, let’s see what you do. All right, predictions, one prediction? Or your resolution? I will say this, I don’t know if you would call it a prediction. I’m trying to avoid predictions. But I will say, I am looking forward to the delta between what Bob Mueller knows and what we know getting smaller. Ah. I think that we have spent a very long time ... Wondering. Wondering. Postulating. Speculating. We’ve seen a lot of charges, this is a serious investigation that’s produced genuine criminal wrongdoing continuously for the past two years, and yet it always feels like we are trying to fill in the center of the painting. Right. Based on what we’re seeing around the edges. A real picture. All right, so your prediction is it will be interesting to see the Mueller thing. And what’s your resolution for the year? And then I’ll let you go, thank you so much for talking with me. I would say my main resolution is, in terms of politics, is about using social media better. But as part of that, I would like to ... You’re not going to do one of those essays about getting off of it, because those are tiresome. No. If you want to get off of Twitter, delete the app. If you’re writing an essay about it it’s because you want people on Twitter to see it, which means you’re still part of the problem. If you write an essay about how you’re getting off of Twitter, it is because you want “Likes” and retweets on Twitter, which means you have still not cured your disease. Yes, yes. But I would say as part of that, and using the social media better ... Okay, being nicer. I would like to be ... I would like my offline conversations and my on-microphone conversations to sound more similar. They are not that different. So you’re reconciling. I would like to be more honest about how I feel. No Jekyll and Hyde kind of ... No. I think it’s very easy to be in front of a microphone and criticize Republicans and praise Democrats and then save my ire that I hold for Democrats till the mics are off. And just get that out there and I would like to make sure that I’m being more honest about both my friends and my opponents. What’s your last message to Democrats? What’s your message, what should be their resolution? I would say, as we think about 2020, one test that I would have is, would you think about this person ... When you’re choosing your candidate, I would like people to think, this is not someone who I view as electable or unelectable, when you don’t know anything about them and I would not like you to think, this is the right person to take on Trump. To me, the right candidate is a candidate you would think would make a great president, even if Donald Trump never came along. Imagine choosing a Democratic candidate to be president of the United States if you didn’t think that they had to stand across from Donald Trump and debate Donald Trump. Don’t let Donald Trump in so much into your mind ... There’ll be time for that. I’m not saying we’re not gonna think about that, I’m not gonna say it’s not important. But don’t worry about electability and don’t worry about Donald Trump. Just think about what you believe. Who is that for you right now? It sounds like Warren. I think there’s a lot of good options. I sincerely, I’m not being coy, I honestly don’t know. I think that we’re gonna have a very strong field. I think we’re gonna have some ... I have concerns around kind of Washington-speak. That’s not about Warren, that’s just generally, I want to make sure we’re not in a kind of whatever, closed off, inside-DC conversation around policy and politics. I want to know that we’re talking in a way that reaches outside of that bubble. And I also think one thing about this too, on the opposite side of that, it’s not just about ignoring Trump as we try to figure out what’s best but also being honest. Yes Russian hacking. Yes there are unique circumstances. They didn’t hack, Jon. They didn’t hack. There are unique circumstances around why we lost in 2016 related to our candidate, related to the failures of the media, the Russians, failures of the media in covering Donald Trump effectively. All of that is true. However, it took genuine cultural and political rot to open the door for someone like Donald Trump. And if we do not have a candidate who recognizes and appreciates that rot, and is willing to say that things were not right, that our discourse wasn’t up to par, that Democratic policies weren’t up to par, that there was a huge opening that we made for someone like Donald Trump. Even if it had to be a black swan, even if a bunch of other things had to go wrong, you need to be willing to have that part of the conversation. You’re talking about reflection, self-reflection. Yeah, it’s January, that’s what January’s all about. Man, Jon. Wow, wow, I like this new Jon. This was always me. You know what, maybe you look inward and say why didn’t you see me before. Why is it you learning something new about me is a reflection on me and not you? Because I’m deeply in love with you, let’s just be honest with the situation here. It’s happening. it’s fine. “Dear diary, it’s finally happening.” Oh my god, we should start a rumor, it would be so funny. Crazier things have happened, in the podcast world. Okay, it’s not happening. Don’t even get into that. No, we’re not talking about that. I know just what you’re referring to. I don’t know what I’m referring to! I think you know what you’re referring to. Anyway, Jon ... Is this show over? I’m stopping you right now. Jon, thanks for ... Put your headphones back on. Thanks for taking Pivot with me today. Scott will be back next week. Jon, I appreciate it. I appreciate you. All right, I’ll talk to you soon.

"In the late fall, employees across Yahoo arrived at work to find a message from CEO Marissa Mayer on their desks. Delivered to everyone simultaneously, it was in the form of a book — the “big red book,” in fact, as it would soon be called across the Silicon Valley Internet giant — that she had created to explain Yahoo to, well, Yahoos. On the opening pages of the thick tome — with a hip design, much font action, a whole lot of bold colors and a vague tone of forced fun — its goal was explicitly stated: “This book is a guide.” I was happy to finally get my hands on one. “You don’t have the book?” joked one departed staffer to me. “You really need to see the book.” I really did. And so do you. Commissioned by Mayer in a project run by her chief of staff Andrew Schulte and produced by Addison Publishing, it cost about $1 million, said sources. Books like this are not uncommon in Silicon Valley, most often made to be given to new employees as part of the onboarding process at hiring. In this case, Mayer seems to have had a different goal, in what appears to be a splashy analog attempt to boost morale. But, more than anything, it is also an insight into her thinking, displaying a mix of stubborn defiance and aggressive cheeriness strewn with the kind of you-can-do-it bromides you might find at a Tony Robbins seminar. “Our hope is that it will give everyone a shared sense of the amazing company that we work for and the incredible opportunities within our reach,” read some text. “Let’s do this.” It also stars Mayer. “We take our work seriously,” read one page, atop a photo of a smiling exec at a computer (which you can see above), “but we don’t take ourselves seriously.” In another, there is a call for Yahoo to “kick ass again.” In still another, the book shows a selfie of Mayer on her first day at the company in July of 2012, with a reprint of her confidential memo about her new job. Such confidence is much needed by Mayer today; she finds herself in a very tough situation as she announces Yahoo’s fourth-quarter earnings. Aside from the actual results, investors are looking for her and CFO Ken Goldman to give some clear statement about the plans for a spinoff of its core assets and also details about cost cuts, largely via layoffs and closures of low-performing units. Most important of all, though, will be whether there are explicit signals from Mayer about whether the company is open to a sale. On Friday, Yahoo’s board met to discuss this critical issue, as potential suitors circle the company waiting for it to publicly declare itself interested in acquisition discussions. That has been pushed by activist shareholders like Starboard Value, which has been agitating for a sale of Yahoo’s core assets. If not, it is promising a proxy fight that will mire Yahoo in a yet another protracted public tussle. While there have been no substantive talks as yet, giant telcos like Verizon and AT&T are waiting for an opening to make possible bids. “No one can be seen in a hostile takeover mode,” said one person close to the situation. “Yahoo has to really show its cards for anything to start.” That might or might not happen today. According to sources, at the Friday meeting, Mayer laid out a plan for turnaround, appealing for more time from the board to fix Yahoo. But a number of directors have become convinced that she will not be able to deliver that, especially since she has been trying to do so for several years now with a variety of largely failed efforts at Yahoo. “They are emotionally supportive of Mayer and her desire to keep at it, but some of the board just wants to get the company sold for as much money as possible,” said one person close to the situation. “They’ve had enough.” Nonetheless, those directors may face a lot of resistance from Mayer, who is well known for an intense work ethic and an equally strong drive for perfection. Numerous sources close to her said she is determined to solider on; still others said that if there is a decision to sell, she will be the one to manage the process. Mayer will probably prevail in this, given that directors are loath to directly attack a sitting CEO, especially in the clubby and insular world of Silicon Valley. “To attack Mayer, the most high-profile woman leader in tech, is not for the faint of heart,” said one source. “She has more leverage and determination than you might imagine.” That’s all reflected in the big red book. In fact, it stresses what has been her main manifesto for a while — the idea of a virtuous cycle that Mayer has repeated many times at Yahoo. Reads one page: “Great people build great products. Innovative, forward-leaning products will drive increased traffic and engagement, leading to greater advertiser interest and demand. Ultimately, this translates to revenue.” And, for Yahoo today, that depends on your definition of “ultimately.” This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",marissa-mayers-big-red-book-a-guide-to-what-the-yahoo-ceo-will-do-next.txt,drew.uq
"Early Thursday morning, HBO dropped the final clue in its scavenger hunt for seven Iron Thrones hidden in obscure, exotic locations around the world: an hour-long video of a giant, spiky-ass chair plunked down in the middle of what looked like a castle. This was a big one—the only Throne that had yet to be discovered—and, immediately, folks scrambled to try to track it down. Within minutes, fans figured out that it was in Fort Totten, New York, an old military compound-cum-public park in deep Queens. Anyone close enough to actually get to the thing—including yours truly—rushed to become the first to find it. But we were already too late. Melanie Joaquín saw the video of the Throne as soon as HBO published it, and the moment she laid her eyes on it, she knew where it was. She lives down the street, in an apartment building just outside the park. There was no mistaking that strange cavern, its large stone blocks, the eerie way the light drifted through its columns. The ""Throne of the Crypt,"" she knew, was inside the old Battery at Fort Totten.  She clambered out of her apartment, jumped on a bus to the park, and sprinted towards the Throne, only to find the gates to Fort Totten locked. (The producers and director who set up the Throne, tasked with unlocking the gates, had only just taken their video live. There was ""no way,"" they told me, that anyone could figure out where it was that quickly, much less actually get to it.) But Joaquín was determined.  She found a small, jagged hole in the fence, crawled through it, and ran headlong towards the old Battery, zigzagging through the park and racing down a long, dark tunnel that led to the Throne. There, waiting for her, were a pair of guards: two towering, bearded men in long fur-collared cloaks, leather boots, and 16th-century breastplates. After asking her a few staggeringly intense questions straight out of Game of Thrones itself—""What is your quest? Is it the Throne you seek?""—they guided her to it. And thus, at long last, this gem of a moment was born: Other aspirant throne-seekers would, in time, come to discover the All-Important Seat themselves, only to find that they had been beaten. Somehow, Joaquín had managed to claim her place atop it about ten minutes after HBO's video went up. ""She got here so quickly. We were in shock,"" Aramique Krauthammer, the director of the Iron Throne project, told me. ""We didn't even know where she came from. I'm still surprised, like—how is this possible?"" Her quest complete, her Throne mounted, and her crown secured, Joaquín left Fort Totten and returned to her home in Queens—only now she bore a new title, bestowed upon her by Game of Thrones itself.

"Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports In late August of last year, well before Jarlin Garcia began his career as a Major League starter with a record-tying ten- and one-third hitless innings, hundreds of children—elementary-schoolers, members of youth baseball teams—gathered in the Dominican municipality of Pedro Brand, in the province of Santo Domingo. In front of them were tables stacked with brand-new backpacks, each of them filled with school supplies, and standing at the tables, ready to hand out a backpack to each child, were Garcia’s father and girlfriend. When an organizer asked the gathering if they knew who Jarlin Garcia was—“Malibu,” as he is known in Pedro Brand—a huge cheer went up.  While Garcia almost certainly wasn’t a household name in North America, in Pedro Brand he was a star. Like the kids his foundation was providing school supplies for, he was born and raised there; like them, his family had often struggled to make ends meet. And now he was a pitcher in the major leagues, making enough money to provide an entire community of children with enough pencils, pens, erasers and paper to last them the school year.  Jarlin Garcia wasn’t a star in the major leagues in 2017. He was a middle reliever with a low walk rate and a low-to-mid-90s fastball that could run a little flat at times. He had progressed slowly through the minor leagues after signing with the Marlins in 2010 as a 17-year-old. It took him three seasons in rookie and low-A ball before he moved up to playing full-season baseball. He wasn’t a highly-touted prospect; he never had the kind of numbers that dazzled, high velocity or overwhelming strikeout capability. The Marlins were disappointed enough with his slow progression that they left him off their 40-man roster in 2014. And while he fared well in 2015 and 2016—going to the Futures Game, earning an All-Star selection, and slowly moving into the top ten on Marlins prospect lists—he was never highly regarded. This was someone who, if all went well for him, would probably slot in as the Marlins’ fourth starter.  Garcia’s first callup in 2016 was rather unceremonious: his manager in Double-A, where he had started the season, called him into his office and promptly told him that he was no longer wanted on the team and to “get the fuck out,” which Garcia understandably found confusing. The callup was more a move of necessity, a means of acquiring some backup for a bullpen that was stretched thin. Garcia didn’t end up pitching in Miami, only staying with the big league team for four days before getting sent back down. But he got $10,000 dollars out of the deal, and he got to say that he had made the major leagues. Both the money and the news were gifts that he could pass on to his parents back home.  Last season Garcia pitched in 68 games with the Marlins, posting a rather pedestrian 4.73 ERA with peripherals that hovered around league average—not numbers really worth noting. His debut season went essentially unnoticed by most baseball fans who aren’t devoted followers of the Marlins. But it didn’t go unnoticed back home in Pedro Brand. Garcia’s success, moderate though it may have been, had an impact that reached beyond the confines of Marlins Park, even beyond the circle of himself, his family, and his friends. All the way over in France, a Dominican ex-pat singer named J Sugar, also a native of Santo Domingo province, released a song in Garcia’s honor. Returning to Pedro Brand after the season was over along with Reds pitcher Ariel Hernandez, the song blasted from loudspeakers, floating over the enthusiastic crowd assembled to greet them.  Making it to the major leagues at all, regardless of how well you perform when you get there, is an impressive achievement, and it is in tight-knit communities where the gravity of this achievement is at its most visible. Garcia’s $40,000 signing bonus, while modest compared to some of the paydays earned by other young international amateurs and top draft picks, was life-changing money for his family. The league-minimum salary Garcia earned with the Marlins in 2017 was the kind of money that could change the lives of hundreds of families. And that is exactly how Garcia has used the platform and privilege that his career in baseball has afforded to him.  Garcia was a latecomer to baseball; for most of his childhood, his only passion was soccer. On the urging of others, who saw potential in his athleticism, he took up baseball at 15. A year later, his baby sister Genesis Mabel died in an accident in their home while he was at baseball practice. He felt responsible for the accident—perhaps if he hadn’t been out of the house, spending time on his own pursuits, he would have been able to prevent the tragedy. “I felt like my family lost its happiness that day,” he told reporters in Miami. He promised his parents that he would use baseball to support them, to turn their lives around. He was going to be something big—a major leaguer. He was going to, in his words, “give them a reason to live.”  Garcia says that he still thinks about Genesis Mabel every time he pitches. The foundation that delivers school supplies and support to children in Pedro Brand is named after her. And now he is not only a major leaguer, but has inscribed himself in major-league history. After two long-relief appearances—the first of them a masterful six shutout innings in extras against the Cubs—Garcia pitched six no-hit innings against the Mets, one of baseball’s hottest teams, in his first major-league start, before being controversially lifted after throwing only 77 pitches. On Tuesday he dominated the powerful Yankees lineup for another five innings, giving up only one hit. He has been an unexpected and welcome success for the Marlins, who could certainly use something to cheer for. Jarlin Garcia might never be an ace. Even through his four excellent appearances this season, he has struck out few and walked too many. But even though he is not a star, and even though he might never be one, Jarlin Garcia has taken the opportunity given to him as a major leaguer and made the most of it. That, however the rest of his career might unfold, seems like something worth celebrating.",marlins-p-jarlin-garcia-may-not-be-an-ace-but-hes-dealing-and-easy-to-root-for.txt,drew.uq
"On a rainy early afternoon in Devon, in South West England, Steve Moore and Paul Barham dropped in on a pub and came across a group of darts players, something in and of itself not too unusual, except for the player's make up. As twenty-somethings, they were younger than the average pub player, and evenly split between men and women. Since the game's heyday in the 1970s and 80s, when it drew TV audiences and plenty of popular attention, darts had settled back down into pub entertainment, in the common conception mainly enjoyed by drunken older men. Seeing the fun this young group of players was having, Moore and Barham were inspired to bring darts back as a social experience, a night out for friends. Moore, who had spent a decade trading futures, quit his job and began workshopping a way to streamline the darts experience and make it more approachable for the uninitiated. Moore and Barham had their work cut out for them, though. The way they saw it, the complications of scoring—so often done by hand on a chalkboard—and knowing the rules were keeping young people away from darts. Introducing tech to the equation could solve this problem, but also presented new ones: the physical barriers of having the power and precision to stick the dart for an accurate score or to trigger a pressure board, and determining exactly where on a board the dart landed would be issues.  They needed a technological framework that could solve these problems, with the most complicated being the tracking for automatic scoring. Similar systems already exist, most famously the Hawk-Eye, which tracks balls for tennis and soccer, among other sports. But tracking a ball was one thing; tracking darts was considered quite another. “The working assumption in the industry, or everywhere, was it just wasn't possible,” Moore said via phone.  Computer vision systems utilize cameras and complex mathematical models to pinpoint where in three dimensional space an object is located. A ball is a fairly simple object, the same shape from the viewpoint of any camera looking at it; a goal line or baseline is a fairly simple demarcation. Darts, on the other hand, come at the board from a dizzying array of angles, any of which would cause the dart to appear as a different shape to a camera; furthering the confusion, players, especially elite ones, often cluster their shots together, practically on top of one another.  “You have to do a lot of forecasting tools,” Moore said. “It's just so over-engineered; the mathematics behind it is pointlessly silly, but it's needed.” Moore put out a challenge to universities and PhD programs across the U.K. and Europe: under the guise of archery, design a forecasting system that could track missiles with the speed and accuracy an automatically scored dart board would need. Dr. Jason Dale, an astrophysicist with a computer vision PhD, answered the call. Dale had previously worked on projects for NASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a division of the United States Department of Defense that designs experimental technologies, and his aerospace background made him uniquely suited to working out how to track arrows or darts. “I guess I worked in a similar industry in that it involved pointy things flying through the air,” Dale said by phone. The final, refined product, made with the help of countless product testing, relies on three high performance cameras mounted above a classic Unicorn dart board—their desire to keep the iconic board unchanged ruled out a more accurate pressure plate scoring system common in bars in the U.S.—operating Dale's mathematical model.  The overlapping flight paths are the most difficult aspect to model. Darts in a specific shade of blue—they've chosen something close to ultramarine; any color would have worked—are tracked by the three cameras when thrown. The math relies on brute force to track the darts; it rapidly throws three virtual darts through millions of different orientations and angles until it finds what matches where the dart landed on the board. “It makes billions of operations,” Dale said. “Essentially, millions of different dart hits are attempted until it finds which one fits all three crossing darts on the image.”  A simple touchscreen interface and video screens add the bells and whistles, and the whole thing—dubbed an “oche”—are the key element of Flight Club, the “social darts” bar and restaurant chain making its first inroads into the U.S. in Chicago. Players input names and photos, and the oche takes them through a variety of unique, Flight Club-specific darts games. Since its first jury-rigged setup in Moore's shed, when the oche system took 16 seconds to compute an incorrect result, Dale says they can now accurately track three darts with 99.6 percent accuracy, computing where they land on the board within 200 microns of accuracy and in less than half a second. The system seems simple and seamless while it is used, with no delay or obvious misses when VICE Sports tossed a few in Chicago. Adam Breeden, founder of ping pong bar AceBounce and the U.S. operator of Flight Club, considers the technology the most essential part of the game. “You're not playing darts,” Breeden said when reached by phone. “You're using a dart board, but you're actually playing something totally different.”",how-an-astrophysicist-used-math-to-take-the-math-out-of-darts.txt,drew.uq
"* Thierry Garnier named new Kingfisher CEO  * Current CEO Véronique Laury to leave by end of Sept  * Garnier in senior roles for 20 yrs at Carrefour, now Asia CEO  * Shares rise as much as 3.4% (Adds detail, analyst comment, updates shares)  By James Davey  LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - British home improvement retailer Kingfisher has named Thierry Garnier as its new chief executive, hoping the Carrefour veteran can revive its fortunes, particularly its struggling French operation.  Kingfisher, whose main businesses are B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France and elsewhere, is in the fourth year of what was originally a five-year programme to boost earnings.  However, after profits fell in the 2018-19 year, the group said in March it was abandoning its 500-million-pound ($635 million) targeted profit improvement and would part company with Véronique Laury, CEO since 2014.  Last month the group missed forecasts for sales growth in its first quarter, with sales continuing to fall in France - a market that contributed 37% of group revenue in 2018-19.  Shares in Kingfisher, the world’s fourth largest home improvement retailer after Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Adeo, rose as much as 3.4% on Thursday, reducing year-on-year losses to about 29%.  French national Garnier, 53, who has spent 20 years in senior roles at Carrefour and is currently head of its Asia operations, will join Kingfisher in the autumn, though the date is yet to be finalised. Laury will step down as CEO by the end of September.  “Given the extremely challenged French execution of recent years, the appointment of a French CEO at Kingfisher’s helm was always a more likely outcome,” said analysts at Jefferies.  “We presume Garnier will move rapidly to assess what went wrong (in France) and take corrective action.”  Garnier is a member of the Carrefour group executive committee and has been CEO of Carrefour Asia since 2012, responsible for over 350 stores in China and Taiwan, with 55,000 employees, and gross sales of over 6 billion euros ($6.8 billion).  On Monday Carrefour agreed to sell 80% of its Chinese operations to electronics retailer Suning.com for 620 million euros.  Garnier also previously oversaw Carrefour France’s supermarkets and its international operations. In the 1990s he was a civil servant and an advisor at one point to Michel Barnier - currently the European Union’s Brexit negotiator.  “Throughout his career he has led significant businesses through complex change programmes while operating in competitive and rapidly changing retail environments,” said Kingfisher chairman Andy Cosslett.  Analysts highlighted Garnier’s extensive experience in optimising international scale in buying - a key tenet of Kingfisher’s strategy.  Laury’s plan for the group, costing 800 million pounds over five years, involved unifying product ranges across brands, boosting e-commerce and seeking efficiency savings.  Kingfisher said in March that it had reviewed Laury’s strategy and fully supported it, suggesting Garnier’s appointment will mean a review and development of the existing strategy’s execution rather than an overhaul.  However, some analysts have argued the group should be broken up.  While Kingfisher has struggled in France, progress in Britain has been hard won in a market where Australia’s Wesfarmers came unstuck after a disastrous investment in the Homebase chain.  Kingfisher said Garnier’s remuneration package would be announced when his start date is finalised.  $1 = 0.7877 pounds
$1 = 0.8798 euros

"Louisiana officials are trying to learn what motivated a sheriff’s deputy’s son who allegedly burned three black churches in the state recently. At a press conference Thursday, officials said 21-year-old Holden Matthews, whose father is a sheriff’s deputy in St. Landry Parish, is facing arson charges for allegedly burning the churches in neighboring towns over a 10-day period. St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, and the Mount Pleasant Baptist church, also in Opelousas, all have predominantly black congregations. Matthews would have carried out further attacks if he hadn’t been arrested, the officials added.  In the search for a motive, the FBI will particularly be looking for evidence to support or dismiss the possibility of hate crime charges — namely, did Matthews, who is white, specifically target black churches due to racial bias? At the press conference, Louisiana Fire Marshal H. “Butch” Browning said investigators were looking into Matthews’ involvement in “a type of music called black metal and its associations with church burnings that has been documented in books and movies.”  Keith Boutte, a singer, songwriter and artist from the St. Landry area, told VICE News that Matthews contacted him about six months ago, wanting to jam. “He liked my vocals and my music. I told him that black metal isn’t what I do. I like blues and aggressive music, but I don’t like black metal or death metal,” said Boutte, 39. Still, Boutte and Matthews stayed in touch and continued to talk about music.

I told him that black metal isn’t what I do. I like blues and aggressive music, but I don’t like black metal or death metal,” said Boutte, 39. Still, Boutte and Matthews stayed in touch and continued to talk about music.  Boutte says he lives just down the road from where one of the churches burned, and was initially shocked to learn that Matthews was the alleged arsonist.  “He just doesn’t seem like someone who would do a heinous act like that. Just a normal gung-ho kid goin’ around talking about music,” said Boutte. “But I hate to say it: It almost doesn’t surprise me, because he’s big into black metal.” But experts in metal music say that a person’s interest in black metal music alone doesn’t make them more or less likely to commit arson against churches.  The metal music genre has lots of subgenres and nuances. There are strains of metal that cater to the far-right neo-Nazi crowd. There’s also a robust anti-fascist metal scene. In the early 1990s, the black metal scene was linked to dozens of church burnings in Norway, which was the subject of the 2018 film “Lords of Chaos.” “This scene was highly influential in developing black metal worldwide,” said Keith Kahn-Harris, author of ‘Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge.” “However, far-right activity is by no means the norm in black metal, and it would be wrong to say it was intrinsic to it.”  There are subgenres even within black metal. Kahn-Harris said knowing which scene Matthews was buying into is important in this context. “It’s vital that we understand the role that black metal played in Holden Matthews' life in order to judge how far it inspired his actions,” said Kahn-Harris. “In particular, I'd like to know what sort of black metal he listened to. Did he listen to NSBM specifically?” (NSBM is National Socialist Black Metal, a subgenre of black metal that promotes Nazism.) According to the Daily Beast, Matthews commented on two memes about Varg Vikernes, a black metal musician who did time in prison for burning churches in Norway in the 1990s. Vikernes, who has been described as a sympathizer of Anders Breivik, the Norweigan neo-Nazi who murdered 77 people, was arrested in 2013 by French authorities on suspicion of plotting “a large terror attack.” He was found guilty the following year of inciting racial hatred for publishing racist screeds online attacking Muslims and Jews.  In an interview with BuzzFeed, an associate of Matthews from the metal scene described him as someone who was impressionable and trying to fit in. Nygyl Brynn, who told BuzzFeed he’d known Matthews since 2014, said most people in the black metal scene were offended for how “Lords of Chaos” portrayed their culture by focusing on the church burnings. “But Holden liked it,” Brynn said.  A Facebook page linked to Matthews, who describes himself as a singer and songwriter for a band called the “Vodka Vultures,” tells us little more about his specific inclinations, either politically or musically speaking. The artists and pages that he’d “liked’ are mostly local bands or musicians.  It’s also not clear what Matthews did for a living beyond his aspirations to make it as a musician. Public records show that he was a registered Democrat.  As for why Matthews allegedly singled out those churches, Boutte says churches are a dime a dozen in that part of Louisiana. “The community down here is hardcore Catholic. It’s the Bible Belt of Louisiana,” said Boutte. “Every corner, you see a church.” Cover: Eric J.

"Vapers haven't been able to cloud chase in the middle of a cross-country flight for years, thanks to airline policies banning vaping on board. But if a new senate amendment is approved, vapers won't even be able to bring their devices onboard a plane in the first place. S.A. 3547 is an amendment to an amendment (isn't bureaucracy fun?) on the Federal Aviation Authority's reauthorization bill, which is currently being discussed by the US Senate. It includes a short provision that would ban vaping devices from being brought on board, even in carry-on luggage. Vaping devices were banned from being packed in checked luggage or charged onboard by the Department of Transportation last October, but this would extend the law to prevent vapers from flying with their gear at all. This has many in the vaping community alarmed. Unlike cigarettes (which are allowed in carry-on luggage), or even vape juice, one can't easily or cheaply pick up a new custom mod after touching down. Vaping devices are personal, reusable, and can be expensive—in some ways, they're often more like a cell phone than a pack of Marlboros.  ""I travelled [to Dallas] with five box mods, some tanks, some juice, and a box full of batteries,"" vape reviewer Jess Hawkins said in a vlog about the amendment. ""In order for me to be down here for two weeks, continue vaping, and not go back to smoking, I've got to carry that stuff with me."" But legislators have safety concerns about e-cigarettes on planes due to a growing number of reports of the devices exploding and catching fire. As of January 2016, there have been 11 recorded incidents of e-cigarettes either smoking, catching fire, or exploding on planes, according to a report by the FAA. That's out of a total of 171 incidents of any battery-powered objects catching fire or exploding on planes since 1991, and many of those incidents involved cell phones and laptops. E-cigarettes are also relatively new and not as ubiquitous as cell phones, so 11 cases isn't an insignificant number. But even the US Fire Administration notes that vaping devices catching fire or exploding is rare, usually not serious, and most often occurs when the device is charging or in use, not sitting in a bag. If other common electronics with lithium batteries—like laptops and cell phones—can catch fire occasionally, too, why single out e-cigarettes? Earlier this year, despite some theatrical arguments against it, Congress voted to make it illegal to vape on planes—catching up to the existing airline restrictions—so there's definitely an appetite to regulate these devices in the air. It's also worth noting that Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who introduced the amendment, hasn't exactly been pro-vape in the past. He was a big supporter of the recently passed airplane bans, has pushed for banning flavored e-liquids, and urged the FDA to hurry up with finalizing its e-cig regulations. Motherboard reached out to Sen. Blumenthal but he was not available for comment before deadline. It's still very early days for this amendment, which has yet to be formally introduced, and vaping advocacy groups have launched campaigns against it. But if it gains traction, it would mean the end of vapors being able to easily travel with their goods. ""They've already prohibited these devices from being used, being charged, and being stored in checked bags, banning from possession goes too far,"" said Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association. ""Any senator who votes for this is essentially declaring war on their ex-smoker constituents.""",should-ecigarettes-even-be-allowed-on-planes.txt,drew.uq

" A report verified on Friday by US-backed forces and a separate human rights organization claimed that Islamic State militants in the city of Manbij, Syria had kidnapped around 2,000 civilians to use as ""human shields."" Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights described that during ISIS' retreat from Manbij to Jarabulus, a city on the Turkish border, the militants took ahold of their hostages in hopes to slow the SDF's advances on what was once a major ISIS-held city. In order to accomplish taking such a large number of hostages, a report by the AFP suggests that ISIS took the residents' cars and forced civilians into them as they made their retreat — preventing the SDF from targeting them. After SDF forces began their offensive on May 31, they've so far liberated about 90% of Manbij and even rescued 2,500 captive civilians; however, dozens of ISIS fighters still remain and have put up a noticeable resistance. This wouldn't be the first time that ISIS has taken hostages during a retreat. More than 400 civilians, including women and children, were taken from eastern Syria in January. Although 270 of them were eventually released, the jihadists had also used hostages for booby-trapped cars and suicide bombings. Manbij has been a critical Syrian city for ISIS' supply routes to their main stronghold in Raqqa. After being assaulted not only by the SDF but US-led coalition forces, the militants here have been making numerous blunders during their operations — including having 83 oil tankers out in the open for an easy airstrike.

"Some federal prisoners might qualify for shorter sentences, or even release, after a Supreme Court ruling today that held that a decision last year on a major criminal law case would be applied retroactively. On a vote of 7-1 in Welch v. United States, the Court ruled that its decision in Johnson v. United States, a case about federal sentencing law, would apply even to prisoners who have already been sentenced and whose cases are closed. Only Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. Johnson v. United States dealt with the Armed Career Criminal Act, a federal version of ""three strikes and you're out"" laws that added five years to the sentences for criminals convicted of at least four ""violent felonies"" or serious drug crimes. But ""violent felonies"" isn't a legal term, and the catchall definition of federal law — ""conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another"" — was so vague that it was unconstitutional, the Court ruled last year. Before the Court heard the case, SCOTUSblog's Rory Little laid out in plain language what a decision to apply Johnson retroactively would mean: if Johnson applies retroactively, any defendant who has been sentenced to a lengthy federal term as a ""fourtime loser,"" with one of his three prior convictions found to be ""violent"" only under the residual clause, could demand resentencing and a substantial reduction of his sentence – or even immediate release. The Court decided very quickly — it heard arguments March 30 and issued the opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, on a Monday, an unusual step. It's not yet clear how many prisoners will be affected. As Vox's Dara Lind wrote last year, about 7,000 federal prisoners are serving time under the Armed Career Criminal Act, but it's not clear how many were sentenced using the definition of ""violent felony"" the Court has found to be too vague.",welch-v-us-a-surprise-supreme-court-decision-will-let-some-federal-prisoners-out-early.txt,drew.uq
"FBI Director James Comey stunned reporters back in July when he laced into Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. ""There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,"" Comey said of Clinton and her team. The FBI cleared Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with its investigation, saying it couldn’t prove that she had knowingly exchanged classified information on her private email server. But on Friday, the FBI took the unusual step of releasing a 58-page report with the findings from its work on the case, including 11 pages of notes from its interview with Clinton herself. I read the report, and it goes a long way toward explaining why Comey considered Clinton’s behavior ""extremely careless"" — even if it also suggests there was likely little malice behind her worst missteps. The biggest concern the FBI report keeps coming back to is whether someone or some foreign government was able to hack into, and steal, the emails Clinton was sending with other members of the state department. While secretary of state, Clinton exclusively used a private email account hosted on a private email server installed at her family’s home in Westchester, New York. And at least 100 of the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the state department have turned out to have contained classified information at the time they were sent or received; seven of her email chains had the ""top secret"" designation. Those two facts — that Clinton’s email server was unsecured and that she, knowingly or not, exchanged classified information — have long raised the possibility that Clinton gave hackers an opening to go after state secrets. The FBI report makes clear that many at least tried. The bureau produced several pages of evidence detailing its attempts to figure out if Clinton’s server was ultimately breached. They note a slew of reasons to be concerned: To be clear: The FBI expressly says that there’s no proof that any attempted hack on Hillary Clinton’s personal email account was successful. But the report also makes very clear that they found evidence that someone was trying to break into what was almost certainly a weaker defense than the government systems Clinton would have been using under the normal channels. But the absence of evidence doesn’t mean evidence of absence. As Vox’s Lee has noted, the FBI has no way of really knowing whether Clinton’s servers were compromised in any way. The hackers could simply steal the classified information and disappear without a trace. But potentially even worse, at least from Comey’s perspective, is that there’s no way of testing whether much of the equipment used by Clinton actually was hacked. That’s because the FBI doesn’t have it. This was one of the more surprising revelations in the FBI report, and the one most discussed in the subsequent coverage: A large number of devices used by Clinton at State have since gone missing and are beyond the FBI’s ability to recover. The digital body count of missing Clinton electronic devices includes: 11 of the 13 BlackBerrys she used as secretary of state (the other two were destroyed by hammer); three of the five iPads she used to send and receive emails (the two the FBI did recover showed no evidence of having been hacked); and one thumb drive and one laptop with the archives of all of Clinton’s email correspondence. These last two — the thumb drive and the laptop — were somehow lost in the mail by the private contractor responsible for maintaining Clinton’s private email account. (This was after they were also previously briefly lost for a period of time by a Clinton staffer during an office move.) Nobody seems to know where the missing phones are, either. (Or exactly why Clinton ran through phones so quickly — she seems to have repeatedly upgraded and downgraded her devices). Her aides seem to have been responsible for finding a new BlackBerry for Clinton when they malfunctioned, but what happened to the old ones isn’t clear. Most of us have probably discarded an old smartphone or two over the years, but most of us aren’t cabinet officials dealing with sensitive information and targeted by foreign intelligence agencies. So there may be quite a few phones and laptops floating about with classified information somewhere in them. That itself may be an ongoing security risk, but it also prevents the FBI from testing these devices to see if they were ever successfully hacked.In a statement, the Clinton campaign noted that the FBI had decided not to press charges. ""While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with the case,"" said campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon. Beyond questions of compliance with government rules and security best practices, there is the question of whether Clinton’s email security lapses actually represented a substantive risk to national security. Without knowing the contents of the emails, there’s no way to know if their possible disclosure to hackers was genuinely damaging. The US government is widely believed to routinely overclassify information (Congress even passed a Reducing Over-Classification Act in 2010 to try to get agencies to stop doing this) marking fairly trivial discussions ""classified"" or ""confidential"" when they don’t need to be. State Department personnel may have been willing to discuss ""classified"" matters with Clinton over email because in their judgment the information was not genuinely sensitive. Moreover, many of the emails were classified retroactively, so maybe Clinton really can’t be faulted for exchanging them in the first place. The difficulty is we simply don’t know what information was contained in the emails in question. There are two levels to this. One is simply that, by definition, the classified portions of the emails turned over to the FBI are classified. The FBI itself knows what these emails say, but the public does not. Wall Street Journal reporting indicates that some of them are related to drone strikes in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the FBI report confirms that Clinton was asked about emails related to drone strikes. A separate issue is that the FBI does not have every email that was on Clinton’s server. Her server and her email account were used for both work and personal business. She instructed her legal team to hand all ""work related"" emails to the State Department, and then in December 2014, Cheryl Mills, one of her top aides, told the contractor holding Clinton’s email archive to delete the personal emails that had not been turned over. Many of those emails are now gone, and the FBI has been unable to recover them. If you trust Hillary Clinton, the FBI agents who investigated her, and the lawyers who were directed to segregate the work-related from personal emails, then there’s no clear evidence here of any serious harm. But if you don’t trust Clinton (and polls show most people don’t) — and especially if you think the FBI or Williams & Connolly are covering for her — then there’s certainly room to keep doubting. (It's also worth noting that the state department's servers may not have been that much better protected — in 2006, hackers stole sensitive US information from the state department's unclassified server.) Conservatives have been quick to jump on this controversy as revealing the breadth of her ""dishonesty and deception,"" alleging that she lied to shield her decisions from scrutiny. Liberals have defended Clinton’s machinations as those of a shrewd political operator, rationally fearful of a Republican witch-hunt, simply stretching the bounds of open records law. But the truth is less conspiratorial. The evidence in the report suggests that Clinton’s undoing here was that she simply never took the time to really understand the details of email server management or how they related to the state department’s classification system. One section of the FBI report makes clear that the whole email enterprise was more or less an afterthought to her: (Clinton) stated there was a process in place at State before her tenure (for handling emails), and she relied on career foreign service professions to appropriately mark and handle classified information … Clinton did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not have been on an unclassified system. She relied on state officials to use their judgment when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address. In her FBI interview, Clinton again and again suggests that she didn’t take questions around classification and email security seriously, saying she didn’t remember things like the proper use of a Special Access Program security briefing, which state department employees had their Gmail accounts hacked, or even whether the ""c"" meant ""confidential"" in departmental exchanges. (The Washington Post’s Aaron Blake runs down some of the more than 30 times in her FBI interview Clinton said she didn’t know something.) And that fits the impression left by Comey himself in July, in which he surprised congressional lawmakers by appearing to suggest he didn’t think Clinton had set up the alternative email account to circumvent open records laws, according to Vox’s Andrew Prokop. The Clinton stereotype makes her out to be a conniving politician who will do what it takes to obtain power. So when the FBI investigates her for email mismanagement, it’s our natural inclination to fit those new facts to the preexisting stereotype. But the FBI’s email investigation points to just the opposite conclusion. It suggests someone who didn’t recognize or understand the dangers of a ""homebrew"" server, and who didn’t sweat the details of what happened to her discarded BlackBerrys. (Understandably so! Clinton was tasked with running US foreign policy at the time and presumably also had other things to worry about.) Clinton, in other words, wasn’t a technocratic and savvy manipulator of State Department email protocol who gamed the system for her own good. She barely understood what the protocol was.",the-fbi-report-on-hillary-clintons-private-email-server-explained.txt,drew.uq
"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives would pay a high political price for a no-deal Brexit in Scotland, which voted to keep its EU membership, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.  The Conservatives are the second-largest party in Scotland’s devolved government behind Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists (SNP) and also send the second-biggest number of lawmakers to the British parliament, with 13 of the country’s 55 seats at Westminster.  May has challenged the European Union to come up with a better solution than her so-called Chequers proposal for Brexit, rejected out of hand at a European summit on Thursday.  “If (May’s) tactic now is to double down on the Chequers dead duck, and then blame EU for a no deal, she will do huge damage to all those she is supposed to serve,” Sturgeon said in a statement on Friday.  “(Blaming the EU for a no-deal) would be an abdication of responsibility of huge and historic proportions and an approach for which Theresa May and the Tory party would pay a very heavy political price, especially in Scotland, which overwhelmingly rejected Brexit,” she added.  Scotland, one of the United Kingdom’s four nations, voted by a large margin to remain in the EU in a June 2016 referendum although the UK as a whole voted to leave.  Sturgeon, who supports independence for Scotland, accuses May’s party of consistently ignoring Scots’ wishes in the Brexit  negotiations and has called on her to keep Britain in the EU single market.

"For inhabitants of Poole's Land, even taking a shit is an act of rebellion. The sprawling 17-acre property, located in a rainforest in the oceanside British Columbia community of Tofino, hasn't been connected to the area's septic system since it opened in 1988. Instead, the residents, of which there are roughly 100 right now, use composting toilets.  That means they relieve themselves in toilets filled with cedar, which Poole's Land manager, Michael Goodliffe, 47, claims disinfects everything. When I ask what they do after the toilets on site fill up, he says, ""Shovel."" ""Doesn't that gross you out?"" I persist, to which he replies ""what grosses me out is putting raw untreated sewage into (the ocean)""—a shot at the rest of the townsfolk. He goes on to tell an anecdote about how one of the campers added a bit of ceremony to the cleaning of the toilets, wearing a suit complete with a tie and top hat as he performed the grim task. Suffice to say, the people of Poole's Land buck convention. In fact, it feels as if they've tossed convention, capitalist ideals, and to a certain degree, hygiene, into one of their huge nightly bonfires, and they haven't looked back. By now you'll be wondering: What exactly is Poole's Land? I first heard about it when I came across a headline: ""This commune in BC lets you live for free and pays you in drugs."" The piece depicts Poole's Land as an eco-village where people can live in exchange for performing onsite labor, or get paid in magic mushrooms.  I spent a day there last week trying to find out if that was truly the case, and in short, the answer depends on who you ask. Everyone I meet says residents no longer get paid in shrooms, which apparently disappoints a lot of newcomers who read the same article I did. At $10 a night, Poole's Land is a cheap place for travelers stopping through Tofino on a surf trip and for young people working a summer job in town. But there are others who've been living there for years and who truly view it as their home and the residents as family. It also tends to draw people who are outcasts, poor, or mentally ill.  Folks like Goodliffe, who has lived at Poole's on and off for decades, resent the characterization of their secret slice of paradise as a ""drug commune,"" though there's no doubt drugs are a part of the culture. Almost everyone is rolling a joint or hitting the bong. While I'm there, I take a tour through a small ganja garden and witness people do mushrooms and trip on LSD and MDMA. One French woman tells me she's about to try fire tossing—which seems risky at the best of times—and then casually mentions that she's just dropped acid. The vibes are reminiscent of a party hostel that just so happens to be situated in the woods. But there's more to it than that; it feels like people are here to free themselves of the monotony of living to work, settling down, having a full-time job, and buying property. As one of the residents, a 24-year-old former sous chef named Cheyanne, puts it: ""It's not crazy hippies on drugs; it's a bunch of fucked-up people helping each other."" They want to indulge, she adds, ""not in drugs, but in life.""  Purchased in 1988 by Michael Poole, a bonafide hallucinogenic-loving hippie, for the absurdly low sum of $50,000, the thickly forested land itself is stunning. There are cedars, Douglas fir trees, ponds, and bears as well as cougars, I'm told, with dirt paths and boardwalks weaving in between. Wandering around, trying not to trip over roots or loose wood planks, I see makeshift shelters, including tents, trailers, tiny wood shacks, tree houses, and converted vans. The residents also share a kitchen, using veggies from their own garden to cook nightly meals. The kitchen is pretty much the only spot that has a decent cellphone signal. Despite the beautiful surroundings, I can't help but notice the campgrounds aren't exactly pristine. There's a fair amount of trash, recyclables, and cigarette butts lying around, and everyone smells… rather natural. I come across a towel hanging on a clothesline that's covered in brown stains. I'm told there's one hot shower that not many people use. ""I haven't showered in two years—I just use the ocean,"" says Hubert, a chiseled 23-year-old surfer with white-blond dreads. Hubert moved to Poole's seven months ago but has been living out of a van for three years. He sleeps in a little wood cabin with his black lab and is currently in the process of making surfboards for sale, so Poole's is helping him set up a workshop.  Without batting an eye, Hubert, Goodliffe, and a couple other men point to the brown pond beside us and tell me they drink from it and bathe in it. (The color is due to the dead cedars on the bottom.)  ""Apart from the look and the layer of slime, it's right as rain,"" says Josh Pawton, 23, a New Zealander who is relatively new to Poole's, while someone else chimes in, ""We haven't had diarrhea yet.""  Matt, a brunette 20-something with an addictively cheerful personality, describes Poole's as ""anarchy,"" which he seems to think might be it's best and worst quality.  ""It's a fine line between everything is allowed and (having) some sense of direction.""  He says it's a judgment-free zone, and then, as if to prove his point, he recalls encounters with a woman who thinks she can control the weather with her mind; a person who believes they have intergalactic space clearance; and a man who claimed to be working for Anonymous and left Matt his passport and a bunch of expensive camera equipment.  But as much as it sounds like a hippie fantasy, Poole's has a less-than-flattering reputation in town.  A few years ago, it was reportedly home to viral video star Kai the Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker, a.k.a. Caleb Lawrence McGillvary, who was later charged with murder.  ""A lot of times if you tell a prospective employer you live in Poole's Land, you're done. Because of hygiene, if you're a server and they know you live in a tent in a forest…"" says a 25-year-old named Adam. Several people repeat an apparently well-known mantra that goes something like, ""If your bike goes missing, you'll find it at Poole's Land.""  As for the drugs, Goodliffe, who grew up on an off-the-grid commune in Manitoba, Canada, repeatedly tells me that Poole's is not a stomping grounds for dealers. When I ask why he's so fixated on changing that reputation, he says, ""It undermines the integrity of the place. The mandate of the place is to keep people safe, not to sell drugs."" (There are naloxone kits on site.)  Goodliffe says he's kicked people out for bringing coke onto the premises and even for giving hallucinogens to people with mental illness, which he feels is dangerous.  ""I grew up with a father who did LSD all his life. I've seen the long-term effects. It causes mental illness.""  He thinks Poole's is a natural choice for people with mental illness because they're accepted, and they can afford it.  ""They have no money, and they're looking for community,"" he says, noting one of the residents suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.  I ask Goodliffe if it's strange for him to live among a bunch of 20-somethings, but he seems to think he'd be more out of place in a traditional setting. ""People my age all want to live in a house and work a nine-to-five job. They're not really my people,"" he says. ""When you have people isolated in cities and towns in little boxes, they feel isolated.""  Of course, not everyone is at Poole's Land for the long haul. Thomas Jackson, a baby-faced 23-year-old from London, Ontario, has only been here three weeks, and he's already planning an exit. (He admits the toilets are too rough for his taste.) Naturally, Jackson says the thing that really makes Poole's Land special is the fact that he can't get good cell service. ""It puts you back ten years,"" he says. ""People talk to each other."" As he leads me through the forest to a treehouse called the ""Pyramid,"" he pauses and says, ""The thing with the off the grid, or hippie life, is at the end of the day, you're still going to get old. People still have stresses in their life. You're not going to escape.""  Maybe not, but Poole's Land seems like the place to try.

"Legendary filmmaker John Carpenter seemed to walk away for good from the movie that made him an icon when he declined to direct ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"" in 1998 due to a contract dispute. But it seems time has healed this particular wound: Carpenter will be an executive producer on a new ""Halloween"" movie, which will be financed by Miramax and Blumhouse Productions, according to an announcement released on Monday. This is the first time Carpenter has been directly involved in a ""Halloween"" movie since 1982's ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" (for which he was a producer). ""'Halloween' needs to return to its traditions,"" Carpenter said in a statement. ""I feel like the movies have gotten away from that... Michael is not just a human being; he's a force of nature, like the wind. That's what makes him so scary."" This new ""Halloween,"" which is currently in preproduction, will be the 10th sequel in the classic horror franchise that follows a psychotic masked killer named Michael Myers. The first ""Halloween,"" which opened in 1978 and starred a then-unknown Jamie Lee Curtis as the babysitter Myers is stalking and Donald Pleasence as the psychiatrist determined to kill Myers, was an instant hit. The movie was made for just $325,000 and it earned $47 million worldwide. The scares in the movie were heightened by the film's memorable score, which Carpenter also created. The sequels in the decades since have seen hits and misses. But Blumhouse head Jason Blum, who's been behind recent low-budget horror hits like the ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Insidious"" franchises, believes getting Carpenter back into the mix is what the Myers series has been missing. ""'Halloween' is one of those milestone films that inspired everyone at our company to get into the world of scary movies,"" Blum said in a statement, ""and we are so excited that Miramax brought us together. We cannot wait to find and collaborate with the right filmmaker to give 'Halloween' fans the movie they deserve.""

Here are the basics:   Russia said it was cutting the “deconfliction line,” a key communication channel between Moscow and Washington used to prevent mixed messages and avoid military collisions between the two powers. The U.S.-led coalition’s actions were further complicated by Iran, which over the weekend launched strikes on ISIS targets in Eastern Syria — Iran’s first missile strikes into the country. “As the Islamic State’s territory in Syria shrinks, the U.S. is increasingly being put in direct contact with Syria and its allies,” said Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal. “The U.S. must decide if it wants to continue to actively support its proxies in the Syria civil war. If it does, it will be in direct conflict with Russia, Iran, Syria, and hostile Shia militias.” The U.S. has maintained its broadening military involvement in Syria is part of the global fight against ISIS, and has avoided engaging directly with the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad and the larger civil war playing out in Syria.   The last time Russia threatened to cut off the deconfliction line was in April, when the U.S. launched missiles at a Syrian airbase in what ultimately amounted to a warning shot in retaliation for Assad’s continued use of chemical weapons.

During the hearing on Friday, the court was told that the couple already one failed insemination attempt prior to Turri's death. A provision of France's Public Health Code, which was introduced in 1994 and revised in 2004, says individuals wishing to undergo ART procedures ""must be living, old enough to procreate, and have previously consented to transferring embryos for insemination."" According to the code, ""the death of one of the individuals in the couple"" constitutes ""an obstacle"" to insemination. In a report published in 2009, the Council of State ruled to ban the postmortem transfer of embryos, arguing that children born from such a procedure ""might be exposed to factors, which could contribute to imbalance or psychological hardship associated with the position of a child born out of grief."" The council also said there was ""broad consensus"" for the ban. But in 2011, France's National Consultative Ethics Committee (CCNE) said the majority of its members believed the procedure ""should be authorized"" under certain circumstances, including a minimum period of reflection for the man prior to his death. The council, however, said it would be unwise to undo the ban on postmortem insemination, saying that, for the child, ""the symbolic burden of having been conceived with sperm from a man that was already deceased could compound the difficulties he/she will experience from being born without a father."" The council also said that it is hard to verify whether or not the father had indeed agreed to the procedure.

She said that while France enforces strict biothethical guidelines within its borders, it remains flexible when it comes to ""reproductive tourism."" ""The state wants such and such law to be in place in the territory but does not forbid nationals to do whatever they want abroad,"" she said. ""The newborn will have no links to France,"" Simhon told Le Figaro. ""We are not asking for a reform of the French law. In light of that, how can they oppose a transfer?"" The vocal support of the rapporteur is an important first step for Gonzalez. The Council of State's decision will be announced in the coming days. If her request is denied, Gonzalez has planned to appeal the decision with the European Court of Human Rights. But time is running out for Gonzalez. According to Spanish law, postmortem insemination is only legal if it takes place within the year following the death of the father, giving Gonzalez until July 10 to attempt the procedure.

" In 2017, the original PlayStation's  Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee will celebrate its 20th anniversary. The game, released at a time when console and home computer power was pushing virtual worlds into three dimensions like never before (step forward  GoldenEye 007,  Final Fantasy VII​​, ​​​​and the  Quake and  Tomb Raider sequels)  looked like a step backwards for what these creations could be.  A side-on, 2D platformer,  Abe's Oddysee​ didn't ostensibly seem like a progression from the 16-bit Marios and Sonics. But look deeper than a few screenshots, and that basic ""platformer"" pigeonhole, and  Abe's Oddysee was quite clearly something else.  Abe, the game's player-controlled hero, was anything but an all-conquering, stereotypical power-fantasy protagonist bristling. He had  some tricks up his (entirely non-existent) sleeve: He could telepathically control enemies, and was light-footed enough to tiptoe past many a spot of potential bother. But while he finds himself, entirely accidentally, freeing the slaves of a fantastical food-manufacturing multinational corporation—RuptureFarms—he's an everyman, unremarkable and inconspicuous in a crowd.  Or, rather, he's an every-Mukodon, to stick with the game's fictional universe of humanoid creatures separated into distinct classes. The Mukodons are the lowest of the low, the servants of the Glukkons, the game world's elite reptilian race. Abe rescues his ""co-workers"" across the course of  Oddysee, using innovative ""gamespeak"" commands to direct them away from danger, and to their salvation.    Abe's Oddysee received several sequels, and was remade in 2014 as  Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty, for modern consoles. The company that made the original, Oddworld Inhabitants, is still involved, and the success of  New 'n' Tasty—the game received fantastic reviews and reconnected Abe with his old audience, while also attracting gamers too young to remember the 1990s—has led the studio to pursue further titles in the Oddworld franchise.  2017 will see the release of a remake, of sorts, of 1998's  Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, a title that, as Oddworld Inhabitants co-founder  Lorne Lanning explains, was never quite what it should have been back in the day. Above: The 'Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty' trailer from E3 2014   Waypoint:  New 'n' Tasty was quite the comeback for Oddworld. I know that you've been teasing what's next, and it makes sense for it to be  Abe's Exoddus, done over. Yet what you're talking about for 2017 is called  Soulstorm. What's that all about?   Lorne Lanning: We actually started Oddworld Inhabitants through wanting to bring more Hollywood-style production values to games. And I think the original  Abe's Oddysee had that, and then came the 3D games,  Munch's Oddysee and  Stranger's Wrath, later down the road. But it was surprising to me, actually, that people want more of that 2D platforming, side-scrolling style stuff, nowadays.  So we tested the waters with  New 'n' Tasty, and the response was great. We polled the audience: What do you want to see next? And they replied with, ""Do  Abe's Exoddus!"" I groaned, but then I looked at that:  Exoddus was a game that we only had nine months on, a game I was never expecting to make. But I've looked at that game, for the next one, for  Soulstorm – I've looked at what the old story was, and rewritten the whole thing. The drink, Soulstorm Brew, is still at the center of things, but that's where the similarities end.  What we really want to do with  Soulstorm is make it devious, highly volatile. And also, we're working with these ideas: In the first game, it's about Abe awaking from being a slave. He's the catalyst for more following his lead—they all realize they're not employees, they're slaves. No allegories to our world there,  of course.  And in the next one, the  original intent for part two was that the slaves wake up to the fact they're also slaves to their own habits, and addictions. So that's where this Brew, this drink, comes in—it's enslaving people around the world.  But Brew is sticky, and highly flammable. A long time ago, we designed mechanics for liquid fire, like napalm, but with the ability to splash surfaces and coat things, and then ignite it. We've got that going now. And what falls out of that is actually extreme comedy.  People were asking: is the next game going to be darker? And it is, because Abe's going through a heavier trip, and realizing it's not all fun and games, and realizing the scope of his task. He never signed up for this, to save the world; he just sort of stumbled into it. So we're getting more into what I wanted  Abe's Exoddus to originally be. It's an all-new game; a reboot, I suppose, rather than a remake. But it definitely still has that Oddworld humor, it's honestly more hilarious than it ever was.  We  have to get the game out in 2017. I suffer every time I provide a specific date, because people will take that as gospel, that it will be out then—when what we mean is we'd  like to have it out by then. But, we feel it has to be in 2017, and so I'm on this night and day, until it delivers, and that's just how it is. ​Abe was never an obvious hero, beside more stereotypical avatars that crush all before them. And yet here we are, almost 20 years after the first game, and he's an incredibly loved character. Tell me a little about how he came to be, and why you think he's endured.  I'm of the belief that if you can make characters more emotional, and empathetic, then you're going to have a greater connection to them, and you'd feel for them in ways that I never felt for the guy with the big gun and the big biceps. Who gives a shit that he can kick ass better? Those kind of characters—I'm gonna be the ace pilot and save the day—they're a little done. I'm more into people who work in the pizza place, who are also going to save the world. He's going to do it in a really interesting way.   Microsoft did some focus testing and basically told us, ""Abe and Munch came back as two characters most likely to be in the corner at the party, with lamp shades on their heads."" They certainly were never the embodiment of cool. But the reason I did that is because I felt that's where we were all at, what we were all in. We were in that position of being small, and helpless against a world of a lot of forces, and a lot of assholes, running things and fucking it up for the rest of us. And, gee, I feel like I'm getting validated now: you've got to be a dipshit to not recognize that's what's going on in the world today, that the assholes are winning.  Abe really resonates with the inner chump within us all who feels vulnerable, who feels like we might not make it, and that all of this stuff in the real world is overwhelming. And I know he's connected with people, because I've seen a lot of Abe tattoos. I met one dude, a big dude, like 300 pounds, and he had Abe on one ass cheek, and (Abe's sort of sidekick) Elum on the other. Like, how did they wind up  there?  The things those characters have seen, in that location.  I'd never encourage anyone to get a tattoo, but I was really surprised when I started seeing them. I always wanted characters that people would feel strongly about; but also that the characters mean something else to them, personally. I felt like people were small victims in the world, and as a result I wanted to make characters that were closer to them—not the best looking guy, not the strongest. But then, they could still overcome obstacles. Out of that, I felt we could build more empathy into the play pattern, even if we were being sarcastic, and dark at times. All of that helped build this connection between Abe and the player.  ​Where do you think  you fit, in the gaming landscape of the 21st century? Here we have these kind of throwback games, and I know you're not into the power-trip adventures that do the big numbers, commercially.  There are things that are exciting today. I do look at the amazing graphics, and I'm wowed. I respect that the world's a violent place, but I see all these games  about killing, and that doesn't rock my house. We kill things in our games, too, but there's a difference between what we do and just being gratuitous. I'm not into the war games, the games that celebrate war, when people are losing their lives right now in the real world, and being totally disrupted as a result of conflict. We're turning that into entertainment products, so billionaires can make more money. I'm not excited about that shit, and I'd never do that kind of stuff.   You seem pretty pissed off at the world, Lorne. I'm getting that vibe.  Well, let's just look at who's winning in the world, right now. Hedge fund managers. Bankers. Corporate CEOs taking thousands of times the pay of those working under them. I mean, it's  ridiculous. And it's been like this for ages—it was the disappointments of the real world that really inspired the Oddworld characters, originally. And I feel like, when I was a kid growing up, the hardest commodity for me to get in touch with was  hope.  When I think back to when I was growing up, at times I just wanted to go jump off the bridge. There were all of these really intimidating barriers in the way. And it's worse today, for young people—far worse than when I was growing up. And what iconic characters do kids today have to hold onto? For me, when I was a kid, it was Yoda. And now Yoda is trying to sell me fucking soft drinks.  When I saw  Star Wars, it filled a gap for me, and I think it did this for a lot of people, because there was a sort of spiritual deficit out there at the time. You had two schools: religion, or spirituality if you like, or atheism. But I always thought there was more. I grew up in the woods. My best friends were animals. My dog had more empathy when stuff was going wrong for me than any human I knew. So Yoda spoke to me: The Force connects all living things. It was a very Buddhist approach, and I sort of see  Star Wars as Shaolin Monks in Space.  Then I realized: Kermit the Frog, and Ernie and Bert, and the Count on  Sesame Street,  they taught me to read. Not school. I learned from entertainment characters. I felt more connected to what Yoda was saying than any other traditional deities.  So to me, characters can mean a  lot more. The songs I used to listen to, perhaps they prevented me from jumping off that bridge. You get empowered by this stuff. You see tattoos of lyrics, and that's the deeper meaning for the people that have them, on their life. And when I'm designing characters, I'm trying to come from that place where, if it registers with people, can they identify with it in regard to their own plight in life. And if they can, they'll embrace it deeper.   When we find something we really love, let's say it's a band, and someone else is trashing them? ""Listen, motherfucker…"" We're going to stand up for them. ""That's my family!"" We get passionate. And that's the best fan cultures. Go talk to Trekkies about how much you hate  Star Trek, and see how you go. That conversation—well, that screaming match—is going to go on all night.  So, I hope to always focus on characters that mean more to people than just what the surface story is. And I think that resonated, with Abe. And the challenges of business get in the way, and you stumble over them; but with Abe, the reason I gave him infinite lives is because I wanted you to never give up. No matter how fucking sucky you were, if you stuck with it, you'd get there. And that's life, man.  It's nice when that happens, when you make that connection. But of course you need sales, too. But, I believe, if you're going to make entertainment, don't just do it to make a buck. Do what you have to do to pay the rent, of course; but if you have the luxury of having a  choice in what you do for a job, try to make the world better. I'm not saying what that is, as our situations are all different, but I think that's what we all need to do, now.  This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

" A playful animated film uses humor and illustration to deconstruct the biological logistics and historical context behind the only organ in the human body dedicated exclusively to pleasure:  Le Clitoris. The documentary short by Montreal native Lori Malepart-Traversy delves into the physical anatomy of the clitoris and how it has been skewed and misinterpreted by different men throughout history.  The history of the clit stretches all the way back to the days of Ancient Greece when female orgasm was encouraged by doctors for better fertility. Up until the 19th century, even the Catholic church approved of female orgasm to release sexual tension. However, in the early 1800s doctors started to rail against the clit, claiming it was a useless organ that made women susceptible to dangerous diseases like ""hysteria."" Then Sigmund Freud came along and proclaimed, ""a mature woman must find her pleasure exclusively through penetration,"" relegating the clitoris to what Malepart-Traversy calls ""clitoral obscurantism.""   Malepart-Traversy spent eight months drawing and animating  Le Clitoris while she was getting her BFA from Concordia University. During the process, the artist says she strived for simplicity and efficiency, using animation as a vehicle to discuss delicate subject matter. Malepart-Traversy tells Cartoon Brew, ""Humor puts less pressure on the viewer... on what you should think or what you should say... Making the viewer laugh is a good way to enter the subject.""  By creating a character out of the clitoris, Malepart-Traversy hopes people will start to look at it as ""something more alive than just a flap, or vulva, or hole, or vagina."" Last year,  Le Clitoris was showcased at film festivals around the world. The documentary was finally released to the public two days ago.

"(Adds details, Trump comments)  WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he called off a planned military strike against Iran because it would have been a disproportionate response to Tehran’s downing of an unmanned U.S. surveillance drone, adding that more sanctions have been imposed.  “We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights (sic) when I asked, how many will die,” Trump wrote in a series of morning tweets. “150 people, sir, was the answer from a General.  “10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry.”  Trump said U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran were having an effect and, without mentioning details, said more were added Thursday night.  Iranian officials told Reuters on Friday that Tehran had received a message from Trump warning that a U.S. attack on Iran was imminent but that he was against war and wanted to talk.  Trump’s tweets did not address whether he had sent a message to Iran’s leaders but repeated his attacks on the deal secured by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. He also reiterated his stance that Iran would not be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons.  The escalating tensions come after Tehran on Thursday said it had shot down an unmanned U.S. military surveillance drone with a surface-to-air missile following a spate of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf region.

"When we spoke to Manchester grunge-pop foursome Hot Shorts about premiering their video, which we'll get to in a minute, they sent over two press shots: one ridiculous, and one even more ridiculous. We went for the even more ridiculous option, because that perhaps says more about Hot Shorts' disposition than is possible with words. Initially famed for their outrageous promotional videos that look like stuff Bill Wurtz left on the cutting room floor in college, Hot Shorts have, in their own words, ""worked their way into their fans' hearts with a mixture of balls out rock and their connection with the real world."" Formed in 2013, their modus operandi seems to be taking the mundane elements of life, like having a crap job and feeling generally weird, and turning them into complaint reports you can dance to. Now, about the video. You know that compilation of all the times Rihanna was tricked into thinking a video was a picture? This is like that, but for two whole minutes, while the band are posed to recreate a famous press shot for Friends and their new and extremely relatable song called ""My Phone is a Fucking Piece of Shit"" plays over the top.

"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - After the victims of a deadly crackdown on a protest camp started pouring into a Khartoum hospital, many previous patients there begged to leave in terror, overwhelming doctors.  Some of the militiamen who raided the pro-democracy sit-in had surrounded Royal Care hospital to hunt protesters taking refuge in the building, said its deputy director, Dr. Mohammed Abdel Rahman.  “People were crying and screaming,” he told Reuters. “They were desperate to leave ... while we were trying to cope with hundreds in serious condition who were arriving.”  The opposition says 113 people were killed in the storming of the civilian sit-in on Monday and a subsequent wider crackdown. The government put the death toll at 61 people, including three security personnel.  The bloodshed dashed hopes that Sudan’s new military rulers - who overthrew veteran leader Omar Hassan al-Bashir on April 11 - would hand over power quickly to civilians.  Shortly after the violence erupted, the hospital declared code black, meaning the 100-bed facility was operating at full capacity. But doctors had no choice.  Three hundred people who were either hit by bullets, beaten with batons, or whipped with long wooden sticks, were in dire need of treatment. Five days later, the hospital still cannot cope.  Exhausted doctors and other staff have no relief – working around the clock because other colleagues cannot make it to Sudan’s biggest private hospital.  There are only 20 physicians.  Aside from treating patients, they have taken over nursing and administrative duties and even cleaning floors because there is no one else to do the job.  “I felt bad staying at home but there was nothing I could do,” said senior administrator Ramah Rahma. “Either the roads were blocked or I had to go back home because of gunfire.”  Six people died from gunshot wounds, two of them before arriving. But the majority are suffering from bone fractures and whippings which leave long scars along their backs.  “They were struck with batons mostly in the upper arms and shoulders and lower legs, mostly ankles,” said Abdel Rahman.  He said stress levels peaked after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which stand accused of genocide in the war against rebels in Darfur, arrived by the hundreds in pick up trucks and formed a cordon around the hospital to search for protesters.  Bashir’s government denied the genocide charges.  The RSF was not immediately available for comment.  The Transitional Military Council (TMC) has said the force has a strong track record of fighting terrorism and a fabricated social media campaign was aimed at smearing them.  On Friday, there were no RSF forces within site of the hospital. Some were relaxing and sipping cups of tea along roads outside the Defense Ministry where protesters had gathered by the hundreds of thousands to demand democracy.  A few of them, who once punched their fists in the air to call for radical change, were collecting garbage left along the former protest camp site where people from all walks of life had gathered - women, teenagers, doctors, accountants, vendors.  On Friday, there was barely any movement in the hospital. A few nurses quietly stood at their stations. The emergency room was empty. No one was attending labs.  During the height of the crisis, when patients needed medicine and other supplies, the hospital’s one functioning ambulance was the only vehicle available - because doctors feared others would be targeted.  “I have never experienced anything like this. I used to work in a military hospital. It was simple,” said Abdel Rahman.   “You treat a soldier and he would say I am going home. Here it was one patient wanting to tell you their story but you have to move on to another one beside you.”  On one hospital ward, victims lay in bed, with metal rods holding together legs and arms shattered by bullets.   Some had spent their time at the sit-in area listening to opposition leaders speak, or studying the photographs of army officers executed on orders of Bashir. They had high hopes of a brighter future, until the bullets started flying on Monday.  Another patient, Mohammed Abdel Baqi, said he was not interested in politics and was not taking part in the sit-in. He was at a market shopping for clothes to celebrate the Eid al-Fitr religious holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan.  “Security forces just showed up and started firing,” said the 22-year-old trader, who said he had planned to move to Saudi Arabia to seek a better life, a decision that had nothing to do with politics.  Some are hopeful for Sudan’s future, despite the high price they are paying for pushing for civilian rule.  Down the hall, a university student said he hoped security forces should stand by the Sudanese people. He struggled to slowly make the victory sign, his hand passing close to a large metal rod attached to his leg.

"(Reuters) - A 29-year-old man who disarmed a gunman during a deadly shooting spree inside a Nashville restaurant on Sunday declined accolades from police and others that he was a hero, saying he acted out of a desire “to live.”  James Shaw Jr., the father of a 4-year-old daughter, told a news conference flanked by Nashville Mayor David Briley and local and federal law enforcement officials that he was thinking simply of self-preservation when he wrestled the assault-style rifle away from the assailant during a rampage in which four people were killed.  “I’m not a hero, I’m just a regular person,” the Nashville native said, pausing as tears rolled down his cheeks. “I just wanted to live.”  Despite his humble recounting of the incident, police and others at the news conference stood and applauded him after his remarks.  “He is a hero in my books,” said Brennan McMurry, 28, a friend who was with him at the Waffle House when the gunman burst in before dawn, according to the Tennessean newspaper.   Nashville Metro Police Spokesman Don Aaron said Shaw’s actions saved lives.  “The shots had stopped, so he decided to rush the gunman, actually wrestled that assault rifle away, tossed it over the counter and, at that point, the gunman fled,” he said.   Authorities said the suspected gunman, identified as 29-year-old Travis Reinking, remained at large on Sunday night..  Shaw, who said he works for AT&T, recalled how when he and McMurry were at the Waffle House when they heard a crash, which he initially thought was plates breaking.  He then saw the gunman, who was dressed in a green jacket and nothing else, open fire. When Shaw moved toward the bathroom, the shooter followed him, making him feel trapped.  “I distinctly remember thinking that he is going to have to work for this kill,” he said.  Shaw said that when he saw the gunman pause to reload, he saw his opportunity and snatched the gun, which he said was hot to the touch, and threw it away.  He sported a bandage over his right hand where he was burned grabbing the barrel.  “I didn’t care. It was life or death at that time,” Shaw said at the news conference, adding he went home afterward, got changed and went to church.  He said the whole moment seemed “light-switch” fast.  “I just wanted to live. I didn’t really fight that man to save everyone else,” he said. “I took the gun so I could get myself out. That may not be popular. But I’m honest to the core. ... That was my thought in that moment.”  Reporting by Keith Coffman in Denver; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Peter Cooney",man-who-disarmed-nashville-shooter-says-he-just-wanted-to-live.txt,drew.uq
" This is an opinion piece by Johanna Partin, Director of the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance  So Syria’s in, but the U.S. is out, at least in Trump’s mind. But what shone through in Bonn, like the brilliant sun powering the new clean economy, is that Trump is the outlier. Not only has every nation represented in Bonn ratified the Paris climate agreement, but the overwhelming American subnational presence in Bonn—from states and cities to CEOs and nonprofits—is fully committed to climate science and climate action. Global collaboration came to the fore in Bonn showing that Paris is becoming a real-world reality. It’s only the Trump Administration, whose pro-fossil fuel panel presentation at Bonn was interrupted by mass protest, that is refusing to get on board. The timing of American obfuscation couldn’t be worse, considering the recent news that the world is set to see greenhouse gas emissions climb by 2 percent in 2017 and again in 2018, which means more warming. This report, which set a fitting stage for former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s proposal to put a public health warning on fossil fuels (e.g. a label at gas stations saying, “what you pump into your tank may kill you”), follows last month’s news that the world reached record-breaking GHG levels in 2016, higher than at any point in the past 800,000 years.  Everyone in Bonn knew full well that America is responsible for a huge chunk of these emissions, with some of the highest per capita emissions in the world, which makes President Trump’s denialism even more confounding.    Check out more videos from VICE:   The leading highest-ambition cities, in response, called on delegates in Bonn to act immediately on this burgeoning humanitarian crisis, noting in a strongly worded letter at the start of the conference that nation states were not doing nearly enough. The letter, sent by the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, called on nations to ratchet up of ambition and action and match what many cities are doing globally to kick carbon to the curb.  As a result of this and other examples of local government leadership, there were calls in Bonn—most notably from COP23 President, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama—to push for more ambitious climate action, and to include local governments as official parties in the climate negotiations going forward. (UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa has agreed to consider.) If nations match cities’ leadership, and similarly aim for 100 percent renewable energy, near zero carbon, and zero waste, then the world would be well on its way towards a more livable future. As we stand now, however, the Paris pledges are insufficient and fail to keep us below the temperature that most scientists have indicated is necessary for survival.  At present, Paris commitments let the planet warm well over 3 degrees Celsius more than what they were pre-industrialization. We really should be capping our warming to 1.5 degrees. That’s if we want humanity to survive unscathed well into the next century—a task that is tenable provided nations take up the challenge called for by carbon neutral cities.  Bonn, then, and any global climate conference that follows, is about getting governments from the United States to the United Arab Emirates to do as cities do. To set a 0-100 agenda in days not decades, months not millennia, seconds not centuries. To drive towards zero waste, zero carbon and 100 percent renewable energy.  This is the moment that will either make us or break us, as no other threat out there will have a comparable impact to our health, economy and security. And cities can’t do it alone, no matter how much subnational leaders laudably supplant federal governments at UN conferences. We need nation-states to take a lesson from their cities and start leading.  As the global rulebook for the coming years of climate action gets finalized, heads of state should heed what’s happening in their own cities. Because that’s what going to not just save us, but drive us to thrive.   While global leaders are busy debating the future of the planet, you can do your part by getting your local officials to switch to 100 percent renewable energy for the Sierra Club's Ready for 100 campaign.",trump-holds-the-us-back-while-other-countries-and-american-cities-take-action-against-climate-change.txt,drew.uq
"It also seems worth mentioning that, according to GameLink's numbers, Utah downloads the most incest related titles.  House Bill 2 was signed into law by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory in early April. The law bans anti-discrimination measures that would protect people from being fired for their sexual orientation or gender presentation. It also outlaws people from using a public restroom that doesn't match the gender on their birth certificate. HB 2 has been characterized as borderline unenforceable by North Carolina police, a last gasp of ""prejudice and bigotry"" by Bruce Springsteen, and ""fucking stupid"" by most people who read it. Many trans men took to twitter and Facebook to protest the law, arguing that people who look like them are the last people NC lawmakers want in a women's restroom. But it would appear that the average North Carolinian would be more familiar with the struggle of the trans women in Italian Transsexual Sausage Fest 5-Pack, another popular title on GameLink. The site also ranks Mississippi sixth in its viewing of gay porn, but number one in hypocrisy. The top five movies watched in Mississippi on GameLink over the last 90 days are Full Service Transsexuals, Fathers and Sons Number 3, Bareback Sex, Daddy and Me, and ever-popular Joey Silvera's Trans-Visions 6. ""Our user data show Mississippi has been consuming gay and transsexual pornography at a high rate in comparison to the rest of the country,"" says Dillon. ""It's unfortunate to see that their diverse viewing habits do not translate into an open-minded society."" Mississippi House Bill 1532 was signed into law April 5. In it, marriage is defined as between one man and one woman, and insists that ""male (man) or female (woman) refer to an individual's immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth""—a laughably useless set of criteria which doesn't take into account the one in 1400 people born outside of XX and XY chromosomal typing, and the one in 100 people born with bodies that do not have ""standard"" male/female genitalia (according to the Intersex Society of North America). One can view the high consumption of gay porn in Mississippi and trans porn in North Carolina as hypocritical, but an argument also could be made that the hypersexualization of trans bodies directly correlates with perceiving them as a threat. A sexy, sexy threat. Why, any minute now we could be ravished by a dashing trans man named Slaven with salt and pepper hair, and a smile like a secret, and the secret is that he loves you. Governor McCrory signed an executive order on April 12, preventing state employees from being fired for being gay or trans, while keeping the most controversial bathroom-related parts of the bill. In a video, he said that North Carolina is ""a state that strives to allow our people and business to as independent as possible, without overreaching government regulations."" He neglected to mention whether his newfound softening on the issue was because of backlash from entities like the ACLU and Paypal, or the humanizing effect of films like My Girlfriend's Cock 17.",take-a-guess-at-what-the-most-downloaded-kind-of-porn-is-in-antilgbt-states.txt,drew.uq

"Nuclear weapons are something so scary and so dangerous — thousands of weapons explicitly designed to be powerful enough to destroy the world many times over, perpetually deployed, and able to be fired with the push of a few buttons, like a gun forever left to the world's head — that I'm sometimes amazed at how little we talk about them. There are a few reasons for that. One is that they're so big and scary it can be difficult for people to wrap their heads around. Another is that there's an impression — not entirely true, as I'll explain — that nothing ever changes with nukes, so we're just in a peaceful status quo. But another is just that the scale of the threat still posed by nukes might not be obvious to everyone. So it's worth laying that out, as this three-minute cartoon by the popular series Minute Physics does. It's a good overview, and more than a little scary: As Max Tegmark of MIT explains in the video, the real risk of nukes is that they'll be set off in some sort of mistake. But — and this is important — when experts like Tegmark talk about the mistaken use of nuclear weapons, they're not talking about a random or otherwise accidental detonation (although that has almost happened a few times). Rather, they're talking about geopolitical tensions between nuclear-armed powers that, by some confusion or unintended escalation, could become a nuclear exchange before anyone realized it was all a big misunderstanding. There are two general ways that could happen. The first are the sorts of incidents Tegmark goes through in the video: One side misperceives the other as launching a nuclear weapon. Because nuclear weapons take only minutes to deliver, the side that believes it is under attack has only minutes to respond — not enough time to investigate what's happening before retaliating. As Tegmark explains, this has happened a few times. Blessedly, thankfully, when faulty readings led one side to believe it was under nuclear attack, the people on that side simply chose not to follow the rules requiring them to retaliate. The 1983 incident he cites (which I retell in full here) was probably the closest we ever came to total nuclear annihilation, avoided because the Soviet lieutenant colonel on duty refused to follow protocol requiring him to retaliate. The second way this could happen is that an actual conflict could break out between two nuclear powers. As this conflict escalated, each side would watch the other obsessively for any sign of a nuclear strike. And some countries, such as Russia, have rules allowing their militaries to use nuclear weapons, in certain circumstances, even if the other side has not. Again, because the logic of nuclear weapons requires a lightning-fast retaliation to any nuclear launch, there would be dozens of ways in which the two sides could misread some action or escalation as the start of a nuclear attack, and launch what they believe is a retaliation (meant to return in kind and thus prevent more strikes) but would actually be a first strike. So why do we still have these things if they put us in a state of constant, if low-level, risk of global annihilation? Tegmark makes it sound like the answer is money from defense contractors, but I'm not sure it's so simple. (It's not like Northrop Grumman existed in the communist Soviet Union, which long resisted nuclear disarmament.) The challenge is this: Both American and Soviet/Russia leaders have expressed a desire to reduce their own stockpiles, but they only want to do it if the other side reciprocates in turn. They want to maintain the strategic balance between their two countries' nuclear arsenals, and they also know that if they disarm unilaterally, they'll lose leverage to get the other side to disarm. So disarmament happens jointly, in painstakingly negotiated agreements, which also include painstakingly negotiated inspections and monitoring regimes to make sure the other side is holding to their end. That is extremely difficult and time-consuming even in periods of relative friendliness between Moscow and Washington. But in periods of tension — right now, for example — the distrust is just too high, and the domestic politics within both countries make such agreements too politically costly anyway. The upshot of all this is that we're left, more or less perpetually, in a Cold War–era status quo, in which both the US and Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world many times over, have nuclear war plans that require doing exactly that, and have forward-deployed those warheads in a way that is meant to deter the other side but also substantially increases the risk of unintended conflict by reducing our response time to mere minutes. That's the status quo, and it's pretty bad. But it gets worse, because the status quo isn't really static. Military technology is constantly changing, and both sides are constantly making upgrades that require the other side to upgrade in turn. So, for example, the US develops a new stealth fighter jet and bomber, which leads Russia to develop better air defense systems. But the problem is that these changes also affect nuclear weapons technology, which means the carefully balanced nuclear equilibrium is constantly being destabilized. Take, for example, those improved Russian air defense systems. The American nuclear deterrent is designed to have three components — submarines, bombers, and land-based missiles — known as the triad. Russia's new air defenses make the air-based part of our triad weaker. So to maintain parity, we are developing a new air-launched cruise missile that can carry nuclear weapons. But this new weapon, by maintaining parity in some respects (ability to penetrate air defenses), destabilizes parity on others (it reduces Russia's response time and could be perceived as a first-strike weapon). At the same time, this weapon increases the risk that a conventional conflict with Russia could spiral into an unwanted nuclear exchange, because Moscow would be unable to differentiate a conventional cruise missile from a nuclear cruise missile. This is all a very long way (sorry, I get carried away on this topic) of saying that this video describes the threats of nuclear weapons well but, if anything, significantly understates those threats. This all speaks to what you could maybe call the biggest myth about nuclear weapons, which is that we're in a peaceful stasis, with parity between the US and Russian forces providing stability. In fact, both sides are constantly doing things to manage that parity that also involve disturbing it, sometimes in ways that can be destabilizing and can increase the risk of an accident, misunderstanding, or unintended escalation. That risk is extremely low and the increases are marginal, but given the potential consequences — the literal end of the world — it's still pretty scary stuff.",this-3minute-cartoon-explains-why-nuclear-weapons-still-pose-a-very-real-threat.txt,drew.uq
"OSLO (Reuters) - Fifteen companies have applied for Finnish investment aid to partly fund new large-scale demonstration energy projects worth $1.5 billion, six of them replacing coal and other fossil fuels, the government said on Thursday.  Finland aims to reduce its carbon emissions and it approved earlier in the year a ban on the use of coal in energy production by May 2029, forcing some of its biggest utilities to find alternative energy solutions.   The government has promised some investment aid for large-scale energy demonstration projects that contribute to meeting national as well as European Union energy and climate objectives by 2030.  Only projects with investment costs exceeding 5 million euros could apply for the aid, said the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, which intends to allocate a total of 40 million euros to co-fund some of them.  “The total amount of funding requested for these projects was 140 million euros,” the ministry said in a statement on Thursday, without naming the 15 companies that have applied.  Of the applications, six concern replacing coal and other fossil fuels in urban areas, four are biorefinery projects, and five are related to new energy technology, it added.  The ministry expects to select the projects it will fund in November 2019.  The projects to be funded will be selected based mainly on the degree of innovation of their selected technology and also  their feasibility, the amount of energy produced, cost-effectiveness, and other impacts, it said.

"Hello All, I'm Nick Gazin, and this is the weekly VICE comics review column in which I let you know what you should read and what you should avoid. If you contact me, I can tell you other things you should do too. Let me run your reading itinerary and your whole life. Here are ten things that I've reviewed. I include links that you can use to purchase the books directly from their publishers, but I encourage everyone to patronize their local comic stores.  #1. AmsterdamBy Simon Hanselmann (Fantagraphics) Simon Hanselmann is perhaps the best new-ish cartoonist going right now. When trying to convince people that comics can be cool, good, fun, enjoyable, relatable, and pretty, I always use his books as an example.  If you're unfamiliar with Simon's work, you can read the stuff we've published of his on this very site. Most of this book is on this website, but the experience of reading a book and looking at a website isn't the same. Books are great, paper is perfect.  The comics in this book are about a group of friends who all seem to hate each other. There's a witch named Megg, her cat boyfriend, their giant Owl roommate, and their sociopathic friend Werewolf Jones. A whole lot of stuff happens in Amsterdam, from Megg and Mogg chugging giant bottles of Red Bull to Werewolf Jones's nude Zelda marathons. There's infidelity, suffering, beak-breaking, and various other pains for the reader's enjoyment. At the end of the last book, Owl had a moment of isolated tranquility. At the end of Amsterdam, Megg retreats into herself with mood-stabilizing drugs. Will Mogg be alone at the end of the next book? We all die alone, and we all read comics alone.  You can cuddle up on your couch either by yourself or with your favorite drugs and just read it, touch it, smell the paper, and be in love with it. Books rule, the internet drools. Paper rules forever. I love this book, I love Simon Hanselmann.  Buy Amsterdam.  #2. Elevator TeethPublished by Perfectly Acceptable Press This is an avant-garde comic that feels a little influenced by primitive computer games with its grids and silhouettes. There's text, images, figures, and things that seem to be about the Bible, the creation of man—it doesn't matter. Whatever it means, it's a nice object full of pretty colors, patterns, and images.  Buy Elevator Teeth.  #3. HAXBy Lale Westvind (Breakdown Press) Lale Westvind has some great Hairy Who/Gary Panter silkscreen magic happening in her work. This color zine starts with some portraits of pained-faced women before launching into a wordless story that I couldn't follow but enjoyed looking at. For some reason the cover, which is very beautiful, looks nothing like the insides, which are also beautiful. I'd like to see more things from Lale that look like the cover. I'd like to see more covers that look like the insides. The cover paper is waxed and soft. Touching this book is half its beauty. When you experience a book, it should appeal to all of your senses except taste. Keep your mouths off the books.  Buy HAX.  #4. Star WrsBy Mark Todd Mark Todd made 70 of these so you probably can't get one now, but I still want to put Mark Todd on your radar. This fine book is a fine, fine book—as fine as a book can be. Mark retells the story of the movie Star Wars as if he's vaguely remembering from having seen it decades ago. Dialogue is flipped, characters are flopped, but the story is told successfully with good jokings and fine, fine drawings. Mark Todd's lines are so beautiful to me. I'm all about line quality. I don't fuck around with people who have an unsophisticated line. One of the first major steps of learning to draw is learning to love the immediacy of mark-making. You have to be able to love drawing before you even get into the concept of making an image. Mark Todd, I love your line, and I can tell that you love your line too. Line lovers for life.  Buy Star Wrs.  #5. Horn PleaseBy Dan Eckstein (powerHouse Books) In India, the trucks are made into beautiful art, and this book documents it. Not much more needs to be said. The whole book is pretty photos of these mundane machines that have been transformed into sublimely beautiful, giant, mobile art objects.  Buy Horn Please.  #6. The Complete Junior and SunnyBy Al Feldstein (IDW/Futurism) Before Al Feldstein drew, wrote, and edited pornographically scary comics for EC, he wrote and drew some way-too-sexy Archie knock-off comics in the 1940s. All the female characters in this book have over-rendered sweater drapery, defining their racks in a way that makes the fabric look wet and clingy. On top of tits being the star of the comic, the main characters all have these double-bubble pompadour hairstyles that look like inflated bosoms on top of their foreheads.  There's one story in here where the fake-Betty and fake-Veronica audition to be models for a department store and model lingerie for an adult man at their high school. Check this out if you have a fetish for tight sweaters.  Buy The Complete Junior and Sunny.  #7. The Blonde WomanBy Aidan Koch (Space Face) Aidan Koch has a lot of good ideas and some taste, but she's not pushing herself hard enough in this book.  Buy The Blonde Woman. #8. The Hospital SuiteBy John Porcellino (Drawn & Quarterly) Reading about John Porcellino's numerous life-threatening ailments and overwhelming physical pain caused me to believe I was experiencing the same symptoms. I began to see spots, and I stopped reading about halfway through. It was too much for me. The experience of the book overwhelmed me. My gut response to this book is, ""Jesus Christ, we've all got to band together to help John Porcellino! Who knew a human was capable of suffering this much without dying!?""  Buy The Hospital Suite.  #9. Sink All NightBy Caramel Bobby I bought this sealed Caramel Bobby zine, and when I opened it I found out that I don't like Caramel Bobby. I guess that's a pretty funny trick. People talk him up so much that I thought he was good. The cover's nice, but ultimately this zine is nothing and was made by someone not trying. Trying is never cool, but very few good artists are cool.  Check out Caramel Bobby.  #10. Carpet Sweeper TalesBy Julie Doucet (Drawn & Quarterly) Julie Doucet has made a lot of great comics, but this isn't one of them. After a long departure from comics, she's returned, but instead of doing work at all similar to her old stuff she's made a collaged fumetti made from old advertisements. The book instructs you to read the text aloud, so I did, but I was still disappointed. I applaud Doucet for taking risks, and I also didn't like this book.  Buy Carpet Sweeper.  That's it for this week. Check back next week, and I'll tell you what to do some more! Follow me on Instagram!",nick-gazins-comic-book-lovein-110.txt,drew.uq

"Britain mourned lawmaker Jo Cox on Friday after a man wielding a gun and knife killed the 41-year-old in an attack that has thrown a June 23 referendum on European Union membership into limbo. Cox, a supporter of Britain staying in the EU, was shot and stabbed after a meeting with residents in her own constituency near Leeds in northern England by a man who witnesses said had shouted ""Britain first"". She was pronounced dead just over 48 minutes later by a doctor working with a paramedic crew trying to save her life. A 52-year-old man named by media as Thomas Mair was arrested by officers nearby and weapons including a firearm were recovered. The killing prompted campaigning to be suspended in the EU referendum, the tone of which has become increasingly angry and bitter and included personal recriminations as well as furious debate of issues such as immigration and the economy. It was not immediately clear when campaigning for the referendum would resume. A spokesman for the ""Vote Leave"" campaign said they would clarify plans later in the day.

The implied probability of a vote for Britain to remain in the EU rose to 67 percent, up from 65 percent on Thursday, according to Betfair odds. Though the motives of the killer were not immediately clear, some suggested sympathy for Cox could boost the Remain campaign which opinion polls indicate had fallen behind Leave. Police said they were not in a position to discuss the motive of the attack. ""Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life with an energy and a zest for life that would exhaust most people,"" Cox's husband, Brendan, said.

A US civil rights group the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), based in Alabama, said on its website that it had obtained records showing a Thomas Mair had links with the neo-Nazi organization National Alliance (NA) dating back to 1999. The SPLC posted images showing what it said were purchase orders for books bought by Mair, whose address is given as Batley, from the NA's publishing arm National Vanguard Books in May of that year. The orders included a manual on how to build a pistol, it said. Britain's Union flag was flying at half-mast over the Houses of Parliament, Queen Elizabeth's London residence Buckingham Palace and Downing Street, where Prime Minister David Cameron has his official residence. In Birstall hundreds of people attended a vigil at a local church. Queen Elizabeth was due to write a private letter of condolence to Cox's husband. Some people, many weeping, laid flowers outside the Houses of Parliament. Beside a picture of Cox smiling, dozens of white candles lay beside bunches of flowers and a message board upon which people had written their condolences. ""You can't kill democracy,"" read one message on Parliament Square. Another said: ""We will unite against hatred."" Others put flowers on the houseboat on the River Thames where Cox had lived with her husband and two young children aged three and five. Beside flowers at the murder scene in Birstall, a message read: ""Fascists feed on fear."" British politicians paid tribute to Cox and expressed shock at the killing, as did leaders across Europe and the world. Cameron said the killing of Cox, who had worked on US President Barack Obama's 2008 election campaign, was a tragedy. Related: 'A Historic Turning Point?'

German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the attack ""terrible"" but added that she didn't want to link it to the EU referendum. Media reports, citing witnesses, said the attacker had shouted out ""Britain first,"" the name of a right-wing nationalist group that describes itself on its website as ""a patriotic political party and street defense organization"". The deputy leader of the group, Jayda Fransen, distanced it from the attack, which she described as ""absolutely disgusting"". West Yorkshire's elected Police and Crime Commissioner said ""our information is that this is a localized incident, albeit one that has a much wider impact"". Family members, including his brother, said that Mair had not expressed strong political views, the Guardian newspaper reported. ""He has a history of mental illness but he has had help,"" the Guardian quoted his brother, Scott Mair, as saying. ""My brother is not violent and is not all that political. I don't even know who he votes for."" Neighbors described a man who had lived in the same house for at least 40 years and helped locals weed their flowerbeds and inquired after their pets. ""I'm totally devastated — I didn't want to believe it. He's been very helpful to me. Anything I asked him to do he did very willingly and sometimes without my needing to ask,"" said next-door neighbor Diana Peters, 65.

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s decision last week to allow federal prosecutors to go after marijuana businesses in places where pot is legal under state law might have alarmed some observers, but it was hardly surprising. Sessions is an old-school drug warrior who is fairly open about his hatred of weed, so it’s natural that he rescinded the Cole Memo, the Obama-era guidance that told the feds to lay off cannabis merchants in states like Colorado and Washington except in extreme circumstances. It’s a move that Neal Levine, for one, has been anticipating. Based in Denver, he’s been campaigning for marijuana liberalization since the early days of the George W. Bush administration. But where Levine differs from many marijuana advocates is that he identifies as a libertarian, specifically the type of libertarian who calls taxation “confiscation.” His first political gig was working for the maverick wrestler-turned-governor Jesse Ventura. After nearly 20 years of activism (both paid and unpaid) he now lobbies in Colorado and Washington, DC, for Livwell Enlightened Health, one of Colorado’s biggest weed retailers.  Despite the GOP’s historic aversion to marijuana, Levine regards legalization as a natural cause for conservatives, so much so that after the election of Donald Trump he teamed with industry grandees to establish the New Federalism Fund, a organization aiming to win the administration over to supporting legalization.  “The social justice component of the marijuana argument—all of which is completely legitimate— has been prominent for some time,” he told me over the phone from Livwell’s headquarters shortly after Sessions’s announcement. “By contrast, the New Federalism Fund was set up to talk  to the right,  from the right, using the language of the right.”  The NFF wants to win over the right by appealing to one of its most deeply held philosophical principles: that states should be free to set their own destinies with limited interference from the federal government.  But while states’ rights has long been a popular rallying call for conservatives, it’s become apparent in the Trump era that not everyone on the right believes that states should really have all that much leeway, with the administration trying to crack down on “sanctuary cities” that don’t assist the feds' efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. But that hasn’t stopped Levine from appealing to legislators in an effort to get them to leave states alone when it comes to marijuana. “Our view is that states should be the laboratories of democracy,” Levine said. “The authors of the Constitution intended that states should be free to pursue their own social and policy changes, when the impact is limited within their own political territory. “Federalism is always challenged on the difficult things; not those easy issues where there is broad consensus,” he said. “Marijuana represents the ideal opportunity for the administration to reaffirm its commitment to the principle that states should have the power to decide.” But the NFF’s argument goes beyond constitutional theory: Convinced it can build traction with the White House, the NFF has deployed Trumpian language in its promo materials, calling on the administration to promote “American prosperity” and back “American job creators.”  On Capitol Hill, the NFF has called on conservative lawmakers to strip away a bit of IRS code that leaves legitimate marijuana businesses paying eye-watering amounts in taxes. Known as 280E, this line of tax code was created in the early 80s in response to an audacious attempt by drug cartels to profit from corporate tax rules. Today, 280E prevents any company from deducting business expenses connected to federally prohibited substances like marijuana. The end result is that many marijuana businesses are paying tax rates north of 70 percent.  “We aren’t asking for special favors,” Levine said. “Marijuana businesses just want to be treated like everyone else. People assume we’re swimming in money. What they don’t realize is that if you’re in the cannabis business the government is helping itself to pretty much everything that you’re taking.” Last year, 15 House Republicans pledged their support for a new initiative to deliver “tax parity” by overruling the hated 280E (that’s three times the number of Republicans who supported a similar bill in 2015). And there are other signs of conservatives willing to rethink their traditional opposition. Last week, several prominent Republicans—largely those representing weed-friendly states—publicly criticized Sessions’s anti-weed move, among them Colorado Republican Senator Cory Gardner, who opposed legalization in his state but is now leading the charge against the Justice Department’s perceived overreach.  Although these moves might make headlines, the fact remains that the vast majority of Republicans oppose the liberalization of weed. The Rohrabacher–Farr Amendment—a bipartisan measure intended to stop federal agencies interfering with states’ medical marijuana programs—has been consistently opposed by the majority of House Republicans. Likewise, voting data from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) shows that Senate Republicans typically take a much tougher stance on marijuana than their Democrat counterparts.  Among rank-and-file party members, the picture is slightly more nuanced. Although still significantly more skeptical than Democrats, polling data has shown growing support from Republican voters for marijuana liberalization (with some polls even showing narrow majority support), particularly among younger voters.  One of those younger voters is John Baucum. Based in deep-red Texas, he serves as political director of Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition. In 2015, he pressed Ted Cruz on his marijuana position, calling on the Texas senator to reiterate his support for states’ rights. Having walked in Republican and marijuana circles, Baucum knows more than most how rarely the two positions go together. Nevertheless, he insists that things are slowly changing. “It used to be that if you were looking to move up professionally within the GOP —or perhaps even stand as a candidate yourself—you had to stay away from controversial topics like marijuana reform,” Baucum told me from Houston. “The emergence of libertarian figures like Rand Paul – and the more populist approach taken by Trump—has made it easier for people who support less state interference with marijuana usage."" “Texas is a conservative state,” he went on. “But over three-quarters of young Republican activists told us they supported some degree of marijuana reform. That might not mean full legalization—it could mean decriminalization or the use of civil penalties—but it shows the progress we are making the case with conservatives.” Sessions’s move doesn’t mean there will be a wave of arrests targeting legal pot dealers, but sellers are nervous. Many fear that mixed signals from Washington may lead to nervousness among banks (who have only recently opened up their services to marijuana merchants), taking the industry back to the dark era of cash-only payments.  In Colorado, most of the big distributors remember the days of having to pay staff and suppliers in brown envelopes, not to mention having to find safe storage for the thousands in cash crossing their counters each day. That isn’t just a major business inconvenience: Having that much cash in transit is a huge public safety issue.  “The New Federalism Fund is happy to keep talking to one member of congress at a time, until they realize this industry is here to stay,” said Levine. “We will keep telling our story to the federal government and make clear that any clampdown could undermine public safety and damage the economies of multiple states.” For cannabis campaigners from both the right and left, the ultimate goal of federally legal weed may seem especially distant right now. But if anti-cannabis laws finally do fall, it’ll likely be because at least some Republicans favor legalization. If nothing else, multibillion-dollar industries have a knack for getting their way.

"Satoshi Kojima’s paintings don’t examine human relationships — they fondle them like a bear fondles picnic food. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Estrangement, reactive humor, the illogic of dreams — any of these descriptors could sum up Satoshi Kojima’s inaugural exhibition at Bridget Donahue, a gathering of painted tableaus featuring cartoonish figures in highly artificial settings. Standing before one, I’m faced with twin males walking in opposite directions along railroad tracks passing an elevated station platform. Both figures have their right hand raised in a hailing gesture, their left lowered as if to estimate the space between their palms and the tracks below. Though the painting’s title, “Last Dance” (2016), hints at an impending and predictably disastrous confrontation with a train, reconciling this threat with the lightness of the painting’s color, its schematic drawing, and the artist’s seeming sardonic indifference to the scene’s outcome, suggests an anesthetized sensibility. For the most part, Kojima’s paintings do not examine human relationships — they fondle them like a bear fondles picnic food. Understated formal elements, often mismatched to the odd events depicted, imply an emotional disconnect that is tenaciously adhered to. Ironically upbeat design patterns reflecting a party-favor aesthetic introduce energy that is then sapped by truncated dramas. Measuring, on average, six to eight feet in either direction, the size of the pieces compels a viewer to return again and again to each canvas, vainly seeking hints about the artist’s feelings toward it. The show’s giddy nihilism is assembled from easily readable individual images that maintain a dark babble of disconcerting humor. “Weather Report” (2016) offers a tribal functionary holding a weathervane, pointing with neoclassical élan toward a cartoon raincloud. The Broadway-like sign on the scene’s stagy plinth reads “ECLIPSE.” With little effort, one can imagine it flashing in synch with a repetitive club-music thump — the generic sort one hears in shopping malls. Kojima is both talented and visually astute. In strictly formal terms, each canvas is tightly conceived and carefully contained, but so too are his narrative restrictions. His range seems consciously limited, extending from sentimental encounters like the Beauty and the Beast–themed “Blue Room” (2016) to the advertising glitz of “DJ Box” (2017). What’s missing from the latter is an actual feeling for music and dance. Kojima’s view of the DJ in “DJ Box” feels icy and brittle. To be fair, it is hardly unusual to feel alienated in a dance club. But on balance, most of the situations in Kojima’s paintings are just plain bizarre. “Beautiful Things” (2013) leaves a viewer pondering floating female figures in red heels, presumably pantless, squatting and defecating into cartoon bubbles eagerly grasped from below by robotic males with square heads. Scenes like this suggest an affinity with the work of Peter Williams, a painter of equally odd figurative vignettes, whose big-tent theatrics present viewers with comparably crafted and similarly conjured puzzles. It bears noting that Williams took part in a group show last year at DC Moore called Me, My, Mine that showcased the work of artists who, like Kojima, share an oddly distant alienation from their own subject matter. In light of this unsettling trend, the arrangement of the pieces in this exhibition proved perhaps unintentionally poignant. The palest canvases of the group were hung near the light-flooded front windows of the gallery, while the more intensely colored pictures were placed in the rear, where warmer artificial light amplified their deeper palette. This struck me as counterintuitive. I would have expected to see the brighter pictures near the windows, as they could better withstand the full-spectrum light and thus balance the overall appearance of the installation. As installed, it appears as if Kojimas’s dreams are fading into the light coming in from the Bowery, where the gallery is located. I cannot imagine a more potent metaphor for the art world’s habitual detachment from reality than the sight of “Candy and Whips” (2015) dissolving into actual sunlight, particularly sunlight shining on one of the most historically tragic thoroughfares in NYC. In a jarring way, it emphasizes how the Bowery’s sad and squalid history has been all but erased by its opposite — luxury housing and art galleries touting expensive fantasies. Satoshi Kojima continues at Bridget Donahue (99 Bowery) through August 4. ",a-painters-fantasies-rendered-as-cartoonish-dramas.txt,drew.uq
"Chicago prosecutors have dropped all charges against Jussie Smollett, the black and gay actor accused of paying two men $3,500 to fake a hate crime against him. “After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett’s volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this is a just and appropriate resolution to the case,” the Cook County State Attorney’s Office said in a statement to ABC News.  Prosecutors, however, did not explain how the charges came to be so abruptly dropped, and the record has now been sealed. “I’ve been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one,” Smollett told reporters in a press conference. “I would not be my mother’s son if I had done one drop of what I was accused of. This has been an incredibly difficult time, one of the worst in my life.” Chicago police announced on Feb. 21 that Smollett had paid two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to attack him because he was upset that he wasn’t getting paid enough for his role on the Fox series “Empire.” A Cook County grand jury returned a 16-count indictment, including numerous felonies, against Smollett on May 10. The most serious offense was for filing a false police report, a Class 4 felony that carries a sentence of up to five years in prison.  Chicago prosecutors have dropped all charges against Jussie Smollett, the black and gay actor accused of paying two men $3,500 to fake a hate crime against him. “After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett’s volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this is a just and appropriate resolution to the case,” the Cook County State Attorney’s Office said in a statement to ABC News.

The most serious offense was for filing a false police report, a Class 4 felony that carries a sentence of up to five years in prison.  After the charges were dropped on Tuesday, Smollett’s lawyer Patricia Brown Holmes told reporters that the $3,500 payment to the Osundairo brothers was “for nutrition and training.” “They were his trainers,” Holmes said. Holmes didn’t deny, however, that the Osundairo brothers attacked him.  “Jussie was attacked by two people he was unable to identify on January 29. He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks made to the public, causing an inappropriate rush to judgement,” Holmes and Smollett’s other lawyer, Tina Glandian, said in a statement.  The news is yet another twist in a bizarre case, which stemmed from an alleged attack on the streets of Chicago one night in late January. Smollett alleged that two men — who shouted “MAGA country” alongside racist and homophobic slurs — beat him up, poured bleach on him, and tied a noose around his neck. Weeks later, police said that Smollett paid two brothers to whom he was connected through his work on “Empire,” to stage his attack.  “This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and didn’t deserve,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at the time. Police sources told CBS2 on Tuesday that the news of the charges being dropped blindsided Johnson, who is reportedly “furious.”  Salacious details, from unnamed sources familiar with the Chicago police investigation into Smollett’s case, made their way into local news reports, including the arrest of the Osundairo brothers.  Earlier this month, Chicago police launched an investigation to determine the source of the leaks in the department.  “Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions,” Smollett’s lawyers continued in their statement. “This entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion.”  Smollett’s family also released a statement. “Our son and brother is an innocent man whose name and character has been unjustly smeared,” they wrote. “Jussie is a son, a brother, a partner, a champion for human rights, and a genuine soul who would never be capable of what he was falsely accused of.” Holmes said that Smollett is forfeiting his $10,000 bond but did not say who the beneficiary of the bond would be. In response to a question about why he was forfeiting his bond, Holmes replied: “Plenty of people forfeit their bond in situations like this.”  “He is someone who has dedicated his life to public service since he was 15,” Holmes said. “He has taken the city of Chicago as his home. He is a good, solid citizen of the city of Chicago.” Correction 3/26 12:52 p.m. ET: An earlier version of this story incorrectly state that Smollett was forfeiting $100,000 for his bond. A judge had set his bond at $100,000, but Smollett only had to pay 10 percent. The story has been updated.

"Some of the nation’s newly minted progressives are pushing Democratic leaders to embrace a bold new climate change agenda that would revolutionize the energy sector and end the U.S.'s reliance on fossil fuels. But it’s also revealing a split in the party and has Republicans sensing an opening for them to go on the offense.  Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is the loudest voice emerging at the Capitol on climate policy. She’s calling for a “Green New Deal” that would put the nation on the path to a 100 percent renewable energy economy, build a national “smart” energy grid, and boost domestic manufacturing and exporting of emerging “green” technologies. Within days after the midterms, 10 House Democrats had already signed on to the effort, including Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who endorsed it this week.  “It’s about making sure that we can get as progressive and aggressive of legislation as a party on climate change as quickly as possible,” Ocasio-Cortez told VICE News last week.  Republicans still control the White House and the Senate, which means passing any climate-related legislation will be difficult, if not impossible. But Ocasio-Cortez argues her goal goes beyond the new session of Congress. She says the party has to lay the groundwork now so they can tackle it right away if they win back control of the Senate and the White House in 2020.  “It’s not even about passing the Senate,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “It’s that we need to have this legislation drafted by 2020. We can’t wait until 2020 to start doing this work.

But now she’s being pulled by the new vocal progressives in her party, even though many of the Dems' gains on Election Day were in Republican areas where new members could be endangered if they’re forced to vote on a sweeping climate proposal that’s guaranteed to die in the Senate.  ""We can’t wait until 2020 to start doing this work."" The progressive’s demand for a radical rethinking of U.S. energy policy is also complicated by the defeat of an array of climate focused ballot initiatives on Election Day in a couple battleground states, including in Colorado and Arizona (and even in progressive Washington State). Democrats lost seats in 2010 after passing a cap and trade bill — that basically levies a tax on companies for their carbon use — but the politics around climate change have evolved since then, especially on the Democratic side of the aisle.  “Cap and trade is a different issue, because that’s a tax issue,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) told reporters at the Capitol last week, before adding that his state’s three newly elected Democrats are prepared to act on the issue even though they just captured conservative districts. “But climate change alone? You’re not going to lose seats in Virginia over climate change.”  Some veteran Democrats who fear ceding power on the issue are resisting Pelosi’s call for a new special climate committee, because they don’t want their committees to cede control over the issue that falls under their jurisdiction. But Connolly is behind the idea.  “I think actually it enhances everything, because it elevates the issue and allows the legislating committee to then follow up and legislate. So I think they’re complimentary,” Connolly said. Read: Sarah Palin tried to shame Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Here's how that went It’s a different story on the other side of the aisle. Most Republicans are prepared to go to the mat for the fossil fuel industry. In the past two years, President Trump pulled America out of the Paris climate accord and Republicans on Capitol Hill aggressively rolled back any regulation they could. So we'll see whether Democrats go big and bold on climate policy, as Ocasio-Cortez and her allies are advocating, or whether they embrace a more incremental approach.  “I think it’s very important that we elevate climate change in the next Congress. The Republicans completely stymied us.” “I think it’s very important that we elevate climate change in the next Congress. The Republicans completely stymied us,” Kathy Castor (D-FL), who is on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told reporters at the Capitol.  Castor hasn’t made up her mind yet on the mechanics of how her party tackles the looming climate crisis, but she says that’s less important than coming together and making the issue a top priority.  “So whatever, if it’s a select committee, if it’s happening in the jurisdiction of the committee, it’s got to be elevated. We’ve got to decarbonize the atmosphere. We’ve got to do more on renewables. We’ve got to address these extreme weather events,” Castor said. “People back home are crying out for action, and they see the GOP Congress just not meeting the challenge of the changing climate.”  But Republicans still see energy policy as a winning issue for them, and they view talk of a Green New Deal as a gift because they can use it to paint the Democratic Party as extreme in their attempt to recapture some of the seats they just lost.  “They’ve got a really radical agenda.” “They’ve got a really radical agenda,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) told reporters at the Capitol after she was unanimously elected chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, making her the third-most-powerful Republican in the House. “It’s going to be interesting to watch, but I have no doubt that the American people are going to look at what we were able to produce in the majority and compare that to what the Democrats are now saying they’re going to do and trying to do, and the choice will be very clear.”  Cheney has advocated for abolishing the EPA, and she’s now charged with helping her party craft its message.  “We need to get on offense. and especially because we’re in the minority now, we've got to be in a position where we're making sure that we’re out there every day fighting, and I think we’ve got to be sure we’re winning the news cycle,” Cheney said. “We need to make sure we have a more aggressive approach, especially because we're in the minority.""

"KRASNOYARSK REGION, Russia (Reuters) - Viktor, 62, turned his back on society 16 years ago and moved to the remote forest wilderness of Russian Siberia where he lives in seclusion in a wooden hut, studying the Bible and foraging for food.   Gray-bearded, enigmatic and with a huge tattoo of Christ across his back, the former barge operator refuses to disclose his surname. The hut he built himself sits on the banks of the Yenisei River which carves through Siberia.   “I like the company of trees more than the company of people,” he says.   One long-time acquaintance - a former police officer - who knows Viktor from chance encounters while sailing by on a boat says the hermit shunned society after he was jailed - on charges he denied - over the sinking of a barge he was operating.   He moved there after serving several years in jail, the former officer said.   Viktor declined to talk about his past.   Nowadays, he lives on fresh fish, berries and mushrooms, and refuses to use medicine. He fell gravely ill last year from a tick bite, he says, but recovered by praying with his ceramic cross and eating hand-picked herbs.   In winter, he braves icy climes by heating his hut using a gas cylinder. When the seasons change, he feels himself physically rejuvenate along with the wildlife around him, he says.   He sometimes comes into contact with people when they sail past on boats or stop to buy fish. Viktor himself very occasionally leaves his seclusion, crossing the two-kilometer-wide river to buy cigarettes.

"Let's just face it: No one knows what the fuck to eat nowadays. In an era when your most health-conscious friend may just as likely be paleo as vegan, the truth is we're all just eating on a whim and a prayer. Even our governments are flip-flopping on dietary recommendations, one decade telling us to cut fat and eat carbs, the next decade saying, oops, carbs and sugar are the devil himself. Similarly, when a recent report suggested that eating more fat could actually help people cut their risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, the chief nutritionist of Public Health England called the advice ""irresponsible and potentially deadly."" Talk about fighting words. The National Obesity Forum, which published the report, does not appear to be backing down. They say that the low-fat food craze of the 80s and thereafter has had ""disastrous health consequences"" on the nation and should be nixed. Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a senior adviser to the organization, said: ""The change in dietary advice to promote low-fat foods is perhaps the biggest mistake in modern medical history."" Here's his advice, and the advice of the new report: ""Eat fat to get slim, don't fear fat, fat is your friend."" This low-fat versus pro-fat battle is becoming the British equivalent of dueling banjos. Dr. Alison Tedstone, of Public Health England (the anti-fat coalition, in case you're losing track) responded by saying the following: ""In the face of all the evidence, calling for people to eat more fat, cut out carbs, and ignore calories is irresponsible."" She says she can cite ""thousands of scientific studies"" that say low-fat is the way to go, whereas the National Obesity Forum only cited 43 in their new report. The Royal Society for Public Health jumped on the anti-fat bandwagon and said the new report was a ""muddled manifesto of sweeping statements, generalizations and speculation."" So what does the report recommend? Simply to avoid processed foods labeled ""low-fat,"" ""lite,"" ""low-cholesterol"" or ""proven to lower cholesterol."" Avoid sugar and refined carbs. Forget about calorie-counting. Exercise won't override your lousy diet. And good fats are good for you. Who will be victorious in the fat-versus-low-fat battles? Only time will tell.

"RENNES, France (Reuters) - Sweden ended Germany’s hopes of a third women’s World Cup win, coming from behind for a surprise 2-1 quarter-final victory on Saturday thanks to goals from Sofia Jakobsson and Stina Blackstenius.  The Swedes now face a last-four clash with the Netherlands in Lyon on Wednesday after a win which means Olympic champions Germany will not have a chance to defend their title in Tokyo next year.  It was sweet revenge for the Swedes, who had lost the Olympic final to the Germans 2-1 in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 but who have now booked a place at their old rivals’ expense in the 2020 Games.  Many will still look to the other semi-final, Tuesday’s clash between England and the United States, for the likely winner of the tournament but the Swedes showed they should not be under-estimated with their swift counter-attacking style.  Germany began brightly and took the lead in the 16th minute through Lina Magull, who twisted her body perfectly to beat Hedvig Lindahl with a hooked volley.  Germany had not conceded a single goal in the tournament but their defense surprisingly failed to deal with a long ball down the middle from Linda Sembrant which Jakobsson latched onto and slotted home past goalkeeper Almuth Schult.  At the break, Germany coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg threw on midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsan, who had not played since breaking a toe in their tournament opener against China, looking to add some much-needed creativity.  Instead, just three minutes after the resumption, it was the Swedes who struck again.  Schult did well to turn away a powerful header by Fridolina Rolfo but the rebound fell kindly to striker Blackstenius, who fired home from point blank range for her second goal in as many matches.  Substitute Lena Oberdorf missed a great chance to force the game into extra time when she headed wide with the goal gaping in the 80th minute but Sweden held their nerve to reach their fourth World Cup semi-finals.  “We looked at Germany and knew there would be a bit more space behind their backline to exploit with Blackstenius and Jakobsson. It worked well, sprinting past the defensive line,” said Sweden coach Peter Gerhardsson.  “We’ve talked about the possibilities here to go far and win every game. A good sign is that we’re now qualified for the Olympics, which was hanging over our heads for a while. Now we don’t have to worry about it. There’s not a single cell in us that’s content with this. We’re going to go for it.”  There were tears on the faces of many of the Germany squad as the reality of their exit — and Olympic absence - hit home hard.  “We wanted to do so much more. This should not happen like it did,” said Magull.  “We had one, two good chances to equalize but did not manage it. That’s a real shame. We knew they had fast players and wanted to defend high up the pitch,” she said.  “That brings the danger of conceding on the counter, which had happened before the break.”  The win was Sweden’s first over Germany at a major tournament since 1995, having previously come close in the 2003 World Cup final and in the 2016 Rio final.  Sweden’s semi-final opponents were confirmed earlier in the day when Netherlands defeated Italy 2-0 in Valenciennes, courtesy of second-half headers from Vivianne Miedema and Stefanie van der Gragt.  Netherlands, Sweden, along with Britain — after England reached the last four on Thursday — have qualified for the 2020 Olympics as the top three European teams at the World Cup.

"After a year in space, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly returned to Earth a changed man. For one, he emerged from the Soyuz landing capsule Tuesday around 1.5 inches taller than he was before the mission. (In microgravity, the spine decompresses and extends.) And, at first, he felt great, Kelly said at a NASA press conference on Friday. But then, gravity started tugging on his body. ""I'm surprised how I do feel different physically than I did the last time,"" Kelly told reporters, comparing this latest re-entry to his previous six-month mission in 2010. His description of the experience since landing sounds like an epically bad hangover. Every muscle hurts. His skin even hurts. And he just can't perform at his best. (Though he made no mention of a headache.) Kelly explained: Initially, this time, coming out of the capsule, I felt better than last time. But at some point those two lines have crossed. My level of muscle soreness and fatigue is a lot higher than it was last time. It makes me think there a linear function to it [meaning the more time you spend in space, the worse you will feel when you return.] Also, my skin, because it hasn't touched anything for so long ... it's very, very sensitive. It's like a burning feeling wherever I sit or lie or walk. Later in the press conference, Kelly explained he tried to shoot some hoops after returning to the ground. ""I didn't get any of them in the net,"" he said. ""Not like I'm a good basketball player generally."" NASA sent Kelly on the year-long mission to study whether a year in space would take a greater toll on his body than the typical six-month mission. They won't actually know for a while: It will take at least a year for Kelly's data to be analyzed, NASA scientists said. But anecdotally, the man himself says it was tougher both physically and psychologically. With six months, he said, ""you can see the end."" With the year trip, he said, it felt like he lived on the space station forever. ""The hardest part is being isolated in a physical sense from the people on the ground that are important to you,"" Kelly said during a previous press conference aboard the space station. ""There's a loss of connection with folks on the ground that you care for and love and you want to spend time with, which is a challenge."" NASA will have to address these concerns during a Mars mission, where a round trip journey would last a year or more. And while Kelly did say he grew an inch and a half in space, (possibly giving him a height advantage over his twin Mark for the first time in his life) he knows that benefit will disappear quickly.

"In the house my husband Rajiv and I share, there's a wall dedicated to old family photos. My favorite is one of Rajiv's dad as a young doctor in California, in which he's wearing a plaid suit, polka-dot shirt, paisley tie, and a giant goofy grin. The outfit is eye-searing even in black-and-white, and could only exist in the 1970s. For aesthetic continuity, I hung the photo next to my parents' wedding photo, in which my dad is wearing a similarly blinding plaid suit.  Below that photo is Rajiv's parents' wedding photo, a black-and-white shot around the same time as the other two—even though it looks like it could've been taken during any year in the 20th century. The bride and groom are done up in full traditional Indian wedding gear, with garlands of flowers and tons of jewelry.  It was one hell of a second date.I'd known that Rajiv's parents had entered into an arranged marriage, and I'd always been curious about how the arranged marriage worked. I didn't ask them about it for years, though, as it took me a while to get to the point where I could even have normal conversations with them.  I first met Rajiv's parents when I flew across the country to stay at their house for two weeks. It was not the most relaxing vacation I've taken. Rajiv's a born-and-raised, surf-shop-loving California sk8er boi; his parents, who emigrated from South India in the 70s, both have doctorate degrees and share a Newport Beach house roughly five times the size of the one I grew up in. Until we got married a few years ago, when we visited I stayed in a guest room much larger than my childhood living room.I desperately wanted to impress them, especially since Rajiv and I had just moved in together after a year of dating. So my first visit with Rajiv's parents was tense as a coiled spring, as I was ready at any moment to demonstrate what an excellent partner I was for their son. It was exhausting, but as I decompressed on the plane ride home, I high-fived myself for not breaking character for two whole weeks. I was pretty sure I'd crushed it.  Then, a few days later, Rajiv called me at work. He'd just gotten an email from his mom saying we shouldn't move in together because we were ""fundamentally incompatible.""  He was furious, which was pretty uncommon for him; he said he'd told her to butt out, and that this wouldn't affect our plans to move in together. I guess he just needed to share his outrage with someone, but while I tried to prevent myself from crying in front of my co-workers, I told him never to tell me about things like this in the future.  But the phrase ""fundamentally incompatible"" was already burned into my brain. I got the details, and they weren't what I'd expected: Specifically, his mom said I was too messy for him.  This is true: I am a mess, and Rajiv is very clean. During the two weeks staying in his parents' guest bedroom, I lived out of my suitcase, piling dirty and clean clothes on the floor and most likely leaving some non-organic trash lying around. I didn't think anyone would see the mess, and I honestly don't remember it being that bad—but then, my messiness means I have a pretty high bar for a mess to qualify as ""memorable.""  However, I'd long suspected I wasn't good enough for Rajiv—to a degree, I still do—and his mother uttering ""fundamentally incompatible"" confirmed this for me. Regardless, Rajiv and I moved in together, and we were happy. Whenever we visited California, though, I was even more tense and on edge than I had been during the first visit. I never mentioned the email, and I was pretty sure his mom didn't know I knew about it. I became even more obsessed with demonstrating my perfect compatibility with their son.  Let me be clear: Rajiv's parents have never been anything but lovely and welcoming to me in person. After we moved in together, Rajiv's mom told me that they thought of me as one of the family, and that as a result, she wanted me to start calling them Aunty and Uncle (which is how South Indians refer to older relatives). After a few years, their unremitting kindness wore me down, and ""fundamentally incompatible"" stopped circling around my head. After nine years together and three years of marriage, I finally feel at home with Rajiv's family. Aunty and I text silly photos back-and-forth like I do with my own mom, and we have normal conversations instead of my feeling like I have to perform for them.  A few years ago, when we visited California while Rajiv and I were planning our wedding, I asked Aunty how she and Uncle had met. Her story made me wish I'd asked years ago, because it cast ""fundamentally incompatible"" in a different context and took the sting out of the phrase.  ""Uncle's family and my family have a common friend,"" Aunty said. ""As it usually happens in India, the friend said, 'Hey, you both have marriage-aged children who might make good partners.'  At the time, Aunty was 22, working in Bombay as a psychologist and about to start a PhD program. So she told her parents that if they wanted her to get married, they'd better set something up now: ""If I started the program, I wasn't going to move anywhere until I finished.""  Uncle didn't want to get married while he was in medical school, but when he finished, he asked his parents to find him a wife. He had just opened his practice in California. ""His mom was worried sick he'd marry a white girl!"" Aunty laughed.  So Uncle took three weeks off work and flew back home to meet a series of girls his parents thought might be a good match. At the mutual family friend's suggestion, Aunty flew across the country to meet him. They spent a day getting to know each other, and they spoke in English, as their two states had different languages.  ""I told him, 'I don't like to cook and clean, and I want a career, so don't expect me to be a stay-at-home wife.' He said his job as a doctor meant unpredictable hours, and that he'd sometimes have to leave in the middle of the night if there was an emergency. Then we went out to dinner with our fathers. We decided it would work out, and then a week later, we got married—and it's been working out for forty years!""  How could two people possibly decide whether to spend their whole lives together based on one date? Uncle had already gone on several of these interview-dates and hadn't liked any of them; this was Aunty's third. She says that she just liked him in a way that she hadn't felt about the other two. ""It's a gut instinct—like, OK, he would be compatible with me. He had a sense of humor, which was important for me. I was twenty-two and very young. That's the thing about arranged marriages—you're pretty much marrying a stranger.""  In India, entering a relationship with someone is more cognitive than it is emotional, so according to Aunty, ""I like you"" is only part of it. ""What makes a relationship work is compatibility—similar values and belief systems. You can't sustain romantic love. Sooner or later, it turns into companionship, respect, things like that. The romantic kind of love is fleeting."" She said that many of her classmates in India had marriages based solely on love, but for her, an arrangement based on compatibility of those traits seemed much more pragmatic.  A few years later, that conversation with Aunty stands out at me when I notice how many of the questions in advice columns boil down to ""I want X and my partner doesn't and we got married anyway—so how do I make my partner want X?"" Americans seem to be terrible at choosing partners we're compatible with in a long-term sense. Like Aunty said, they marry based on romantic love and physical attraction, and roughly half of those marriages fizzle out in divorce. Aunty and Uncle married as strangers, but the initial awkwardness of the situation matured into one of most genuinely happy marriages I've witnessed. Keeping in mind that there's other factors involved, the divorce rate in India is around one percent, and I sometimes wonder what direction America's gross domestic happiness would head if arranged marriages were more common.  Before I began dating Rajiv, I harbored biases I didn't realize I had. As a child, I read books in which a plucky heroine escaped from an arranged marriage, and I've read a reasonable amount of adult-focused fiction that addresses the subject as well. Along the way, I developed an (incorrect) understanding that the power dynamic in arranged marriages was inherently oppressive for women because it didn't allow them to make their own choices. I'd personally hate for my parents to make that sort of decision for me, so I assumed that others wouldn't be thrilled either.  Obviously, though, I wasn't raised in a culture where that was the norm. I was raised to believe that the Western way of finding a partner was the only way to find happiness, and after meeting Rajiv's parents as well as other relatives who had arranged marriages, it's clear that's not true. From Aunty's point of view, arranged marriage is just more rational, and now that I'm able to see it from her point of view, finding a partner purely through romantic means seems more illogical—especially as I notice incompatibilities in my own relationship and the relationships of those around me. I still wouldn't want an arranged marriage, but I no longer think the Western way of doing things is better, either.  Recently, I mustered the courage to ask Aunty about Rajiv and me being ""fundamentally incompatible."" I was right—she hadn't known that Rajiv had told me, and she offered to explain why she said that. ""When we met your parents, we felt like we were friends from a long time ago—we shared the same values,"" she said ""Your work ethic, your values, your moral character—they match! The rest of it is individual stuff, and ultimately, these things are fixable. What I was saying to Rajiv was 'Think this through'—that's all. 'Go in with your eyes open.'""  I do sometimes wonder if Rajiv would be happier if he'd been matched with someone who didn't forget to scoop the cat box, or leave old cups of coffee around the house like moldy Easter eggs. But we both went in with our eyes open.  Follow Emily Guendelsberger on Twitter. ",what-i-learned-about-arranged-marriage-from-my-indian-inlaws.txt,drew.uq
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s economy grew at a slightly faster-than-expected pace of 6.8 percent in the first quarter, buoyed by strong consumer demand and robust property investment.   Resilience in the world’s second-largest economy will likely keep a synchronized global recovery on track for a while longer, even as China faces rising tensions with the United States that could impact billions of dollars in trade.   But economists still expect China to lose momentum in coming quarters as Beijing forces local governments to scale back infrastructure projects to contain their debt, and as property sales cool further due to strict government controls on purchases to fight speculation.      Consumption, which accounted for almost 80 percent of economic growth in the first quarter, played a significant role in supporting the economy even as risks grew for Chinese exporters.  March retail sales rose 10.1 percent from a year earlier, slightly more than expected and the strongest pace in four months, with consumers buying more of almost everything from cosmetics to furniture and home appliances.  “The retail sales data tells you a lot about consumption. It is not seasonal - if you look at growth in cosmetics, spending on clothing, spending on automobiles, there has been a persistent trend for a few months,” said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.   “Consumption is really strong, there is strong wage growth in urban areas. We underestimated the power of consumption in China.”  China’s export sector also posted solid growth in the first quarter, with shipments to the U.S. jumping 14.8 percent on-year. Some analysts have speculated Chinese firms may have rushed out deliveries to the U.S. as tariff threats loomed.  However, net exports overall were a drag on GDP growth in the quarter after giving an added boost to the economy last year, highlighting the need for sustained strength in domestic demand if significant new tariffs are imposed.      “We don’t expect (the U.S.-China tensions) will evolve into a full-scale trade war, but we also argue this uncertainty will not disappear and we expect a bumpy road of negotiations. In terms of the impact of potential tariffs, it is pretty limited, particularly this year,” said Haibin Zhu, chief China economist at JP Morgan in Hong Kong.   “Even in the worst scenario that both countries start to implement the $50 billion tariffs, we’re talking about a few tenths of a percentage point and most likely it will only start to affect the economy late this year and in 2019.”  CRACKDOWNS ON FINANCIAL RISKS, POLLUTION TO CONTINUE          Analysts polled by Reuters had expected January-March GDP to grow 6.7 percent from a year earlier, slowing marginally from the pace in late 2017.  China’s GDP has now grown 6.8 percent for three straight quarters, a remarkably steady pace for such a large and dynamic economy and reinforcing concerns about the reliability of official data.  On a quarterly seasonally adjusted basis, GDP grew 1.4 percent, slightly less than expected and easing from 1.6 percent in October-December, again suggesting the economy may be losing some steam.  Still, growth remained comfortably above the government’s target of around 6.5 percent for the full year, giving policymakers room to further reduce risks in China’s financial system and rein in pollution without stalling economic growth.   Authorities have repeated pledged to reduce a mountain of corporate debt in the name of national security, though they have moved cautiously to avoid stunting business activity.   Beijing has also stuck to its campaign of shuttering heavily polluting factories as it tries to encourage more sustainable and higher quality growth from “new economy” sectors such as technology.   Smokestack industries have been a key focus of that pivot in industrial policy, even though it is weighing on China’s overall manufacturing outlook.   Industrial output expanded 6.0 percent in March on-year, the slowest pace in seven months. Analysts had predicted output growth would cool to 6.2 percent from 7.2 percent in the first two months of the year.   “Underneath the stable GDP growth is quite rapid rebalancing from industrial, investment and old economy sectors to consumption, services and new economy sectors like tech,” said Robert Subbaraman, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Nomura in Singapore.  “The more timely March data, however, point to nascent signs of a growth slowdown underway, led by these old economy sectors.”  First-quarter readings on China’s property sector, a key economic driver, were mixed but also appeared to reflect the growing influence of changing government policies.  Real estate investment accelerated to 10.4 percent in the  quarter - the fastest pace in three years - compared with a 9.9 percent rise in the first two months of this year.  Analysts say a significant rise in land prices, as well as a government push to build more public housing, could have contributed to the unexpected strength in the headline figure and a jump in construction starts.  Property sales, however, continued to slow amid a flurry of government measures to get soaring home prices under control and rising mortgage rates. Sales by floor area rose 3.6 percent in the quarter, easing from earlier in the year.  Fixed-asset investment has also faltered as Beijing urges local governments to refrain from rampant borrowing to finance glamour projects to beat economic growth targets.   January-March fixed-asset investment growth slowed to 7.5 percent, below expectations and 7.9 percent in January-February.  Infrastructure investment rose 13 percent on-year, easing slightly from January-February.  In one surprise shift, private investment - which accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China - grew faster than state firms’ investment for the first time in over two years.  Private-sector fixed-asset investment rose 8.9 percent in January-March, accelerating from an increase of 8.1 percent in the first two months.  “The pickup in private investment this year is mainly the result of improving corporate profits from last year and government policy support. Bank lending at the start of the year also helped,” David Qu, a Shanghai-based economist at ANZ.   Despite a more upbeat first quarter than expected, analysts still predict China’s economic growth will slow to 6.5 percent this year, with the ongoing regulatory crackdown and U.S. trade dispute seen as key risks, a Reuters poll showed.[ECILT/CN]  Reporting by Elias Glenn; Additional reporting by Yawen Chen and Stella Qiu in BEIJING and Marius Zaharia in HONG KONG; Writing by Ryan Woo; Editing by Kim Coghill",china-posts-strong-growth-despite-trade-concerns.txt,drew.uq

"President Donald Trump is taking his trade war pitch to the people. His message: “Tariffs are the greatest!” Except they’re not — and even his chief economic adviser has said so. In a tweet early Tuesday morning, the president sought to reassure Americans that the tariffs he’s imposed on China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union, and Japan are a good idea. His administration has targeted steel and aluminum imports from many American allies, put tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, and is looking to escalate by potentially increasing China tariffs and imposing a tax on imported cars and parts. Many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, policy experts, and business groups are urging Trump to put on the brakes, but he appears to be moving full speed ahead. “Tariffs are the greatest,” he tweeted on Tuesday. “Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. It’s a simple as that — and everybody’s talking!” He reassured Americans that “all will be Great,” despite the growing concerns about his tactics. Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. It’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking! Remember, we are the “piggy bank” that’s being robbed. All will be Great! Speaking to CNBC on Friday, Trump appeared similarly emboldened and brushed aside concerns about the consequences of his trade tactics. He suggested that now is the time to launch trade aggressions because the stock market is up. “You know the expression, ‘We’re playing with the bank’s money,’ right?” Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services. They’re meant to raise revenue or protect domestic industries from foreign competition, but they often result in higher prices for businesses that rely on the imported goods — say, manufacturers that use steel and aluminum imports in their supply chain — and, ultimately, for consumers when companies pass on the extra prices to them. Trump is enacting tariffs in an effort to extract demands from foreign countries, though in most cases, experts say it’s not clear what he wants. There is a chorus of voices warning against the potential consequences of a trade war, including National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow — at least before he worked for Trump. In a March op-ed, Kudlow warned Trump that tariffs are likely to backfire and argued that they’re really tax hikes. Referring specifically to the steel and aluminum tariffs, Kudlow wrote, “Since so many of the things American consumers buy today are made of steel or aluminum, a 25 percent tariff will likely get passed on to consumers at the cash register. This is a regressive tax on low-income families.” .@POTUS this morning: ""Tariffs are the greatest!""His current chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow wrote a joint op-ed in March explaining to @POTUS why ""tariff hikes are really tax hikes"" that ""almost always deliver an unhappy ending."" https://t.co/5jA3qSsT7o https://t.co/ddZcuPq3Tw Thus far, the effects of Trump’s trade war have been limited. Specific companies have seen consequences — for example, Harley-Davidson and Mid-Continent Nail — as have industries such as agriculture and home appliances. There have also been warnings that Trump’s tariffs could wipe out any positive effects of the tax cuts the GOP passed in 2017. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation estimates that Trump’s enacted and proposed tariffs completely reverse the tax bill’s positive effects on the labor force. It estimates the tariffs enacted so far will reduce wages by 0.04 percent and eliminate more than 48,000 jobs. If the White House enacts every tariff it’s threatened, it would reduce wages by 0.26 percent and slash 277,000 jobs. In other words, tariffs aren’t as “great” as Trump wants everyone to think. And just because the stock market is up (it’s gained significantly since Trump’s inauguration but is actually relatively flat this year) and the economy is good doesn’t mean Trump has “play money” to work with. Mark Zandi, the chief economist with Moody’s Analytics, in an email weighed in on Trump’s assertion that things are so good right now that it’s time to get aggressive on trade. The president’s view is “deeply vexed,” Zandi said. “The economy is strong, but only because it is being temporarily juiced up by deficit-financed tax cuts and increases in government spending. He is borrowing money to pay for the trade war. Ironically, he is borrowing the money in part from the very countries he is fighting with (e.g., China, Japan, Canada, Europe).” The United States’ trading partners don’t appear to be backing down; instead, they’ve hit the US with retaliatory tariffs. The rhetoric isn’t cooling down either, with Trump declaring Europe one of America’s biggest “foes” just this month. The trade war “will almost certainly diminish the US position as the center of the global economy and financial system,” Zandi said. “Trump’s trade war may become his Vietnam if he doesn’t rethink things soon.”",trump-tweets-tariffs-are-the-greatest-experts-say-theyre-not.txt,drew.uq

"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday handed another setback to gun rights advocates challenging President Donald Trump’s ban on “bump stock” devices that enable semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly.  With two conservative justices dissenting, the court refused to temporarily exempt from the ban a group of plaintiffs including the Firearms Policy Foundation while their legal challenge continues to be litigated in Washington.  The Supreme Court twice previously rejected requests by gun rights advocates - in the case in the U.S. capital and a similar one in Michigan - to temporarily block the ban while legal challenges proceed in lower courts.  The ban, which went into effect on March 26, was embraced by Trump following a 2017 massacre in Las Vegas that killed 58 people in which the gunman used bump stocks.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had temporarily blocked the ban’s enforcement against the specific challengers in the litigation it was handling, but on April 1 ruled in the administration’s favor and refused to lift the ban.   The challengers then returned to the Supreme Court to try to prevent the policy from applying specifically to them. In Friday’s order, Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch said they would have granted the request to exempt the challengers.  Bump stocks use a gun’s recoil to bump its trigger, enabling a semiautomatic weapon to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, which can transform it into a machine gun.  The ban requires owners to turn in or destroy the attachments. People caught in possession of them could face up to 10 years in prison. The ban represents a rare recent instance of gun control at the federal level in a country that has experienced a series of mass shootings.

"The Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn, Germany says it has no plans to cancel its exhibition on the pop star despite a new documentary investigating Jackson’s alleged history of sexually abusing minors. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Despite newly-publicized allegations that Michael Jackson repeatedly molested children, a blockbuster art exhibition celebrating the singer will continue its world tour. A spokesperson for the Bundekunsthalle in Bonn, Germany told Hyperallergic over email that the museum has no plans to cancel Michael Jackson: On the Wall, although the institution is closely monitoring discussions surrounding the recently-released HBO documentary, Leaving Neverland. The exhibition, which examines the musician’s influence on contemporary art, first opened at London’s National Portrait Gallery last summer before traveling to the Grand Palais in Paris. Currently, On the Wall is scheduled to open in Bonn for a four-month run starting on March 22 before heading toward Finland in August. The show contains works by 40 artists including Andy Warhol, David Hammons, Paul McCarthy, Isa Genzken, Kehinde Wiley, and Jordan Wolfson. While the exhibition was developed by NPG in cooperation with the musician’s estate, the Leaving Neverland documentary released without the Jackson family’s approval. In fact, the pop star’s estate is suing HBO for potentially more than $100 million, in part because the film’s director, Dan Reed, never requested their comment. When Jackson died in 2009, he had fought against multiple allegations of child sexual abuse for over 15 years. Leaving Neverland details the separate accounts of two men, now in their 30s, who say the celebrity began long-running relationships with them when they were just 7 and 10 years old. The four-hour documentary describes in detail how Jackson allegedly manipulated those around him to gain access to young boys. Stories within the film include the star’s secret system of bells to warn of approaching adults; a mock wedding ceremony with a child and studded diamond ring; a series of slumber parties that turned into sex; and unaware parents who were ecstatic to be guests at Jackson’s Neverland Ranch. “The allegations made in the film are shocking,” the museum said in a statement originally written in German, “the lawsuit, however, has not been resolved and since Michael Jackson’s death [these allegations] have been considerably more difficult to prove.” The exhibition’s curatorial thesis seems tailored to anticipate and avoid confronting the singer’s history of child sexual abuse allegations. Museum organizers have avoided “discussing his biography” in favor of “examining Jackson’s cultural impact,” according to the Bunderkunsthalle’s statement.",german-museum-plans-to-open-michael-jackson-exhibition-despite-leaving-neverland-controversy.txt,drew.uq
"“Slow,” “steady” and “deliberate” are rarely used when describing Uber. But months after an Uber vehicle operating in autonomous mode fatally crashed into a pedestrian, the company has had no choice but to move carefully. After pulling all of its self-driving cars off public roads, laying off all the vehicle operators in Pittsburgh and San Francisco and shutting down its Arizona self-driving operation, Uber is very gradually beginning to prepare to start testing self-driving cars again. That starts with manually driving its fleet of Volvo XC90s in Pittsburgh to map out the streets. Mapping out city streets is essentially square one for testing self-driving cars — that’s a tough spot to be in as a company with serious ambitions for developing autonomous technology, especially in the face of massive competition. But Uber has to move slowly to regain the trust of not just the public, but also city and local governments. This gradual start in Pittsburgh also gives Uber time to implement some of the safety features and changes recommended by an internal team of experts that conducted a review of the company’s self-driving development and operation. Those changes may seem small individually, but together they point to a significant change in how Uber is thinking about self-driving. While much of the inception and some of the way in which the company later operated its self-driving efforts was fueled by competition — specifically with Google parent company Alphabet — the company is now introducing features and technology that prioritize safety. Specifically, Uber is going back to having two people in each car, and will be monitoring its safety drivers — the people who are designated to take over control of the car as needed — in real time. It’s not common for autonomous test cars to be driven with just one person behind the wheel so early in the technology’s development. But around November 2017, Uber switched two safety drivers to one for many of its cars, in part to increase the number of miles each car was driven in autonomous mode, sources told Recode. Miles driven autonomously is just one of many barometers for how advanced a company’s technology is and is how the software driving the cars learns and gains more experience. An Uber spokesperson said that the company decided to make the transition from two drivers to one because the company felt that the role of the second operator — which was to gather information about how well the car was driving itself — could be done after the fact and didn’t have to be done in real time. A byproduct of that, however, is drivers were left alone to determine when to take over control over the car as needed, and there was no one there to ensure they were not distracted. Add to that, the company’s in-car camera system did not detect when a driver was distracted — it simply recorded the driver. That means in order to see whether a driver was distracted at any point in time, a manager had to manually go through the footage after the fact. While sources say that was inefficient in and of itself, it was also exacerbated by how quickly Uber was hiring safety drivers. In Arizona, some managers were in charge of about 25 people, one source said, making it difficult to spot-check whether anyone had unsafe driving behaviors. That said, if a driver was caught doing something unsafe, the company typically had a one-strike policy, sources said. This new off-the-shelf camera system Uber is integrating will instead detect distracted driving in real time, log it into the system automatically, and then make a noise to alert the driver to pay attention. (Similar to a system that startup Nauto has built.) So managers will simply have to look at the software or platform to see all the instances of a driver being distracted. While an Uber spokesperson said the company was being more deliberate about the ratio of managers to vehicle operators — the company is filling about 55 roles for what it calls “mission specialists” — this new real-time alert system will help alleviate some of the difficulty of auditing driving behavior manually. That’s hugely important. A closer investigation of the fatal crash that took the life of Elaine Herzberg in Arizona revealed that Uber relied heavily on the humans sitting behind the wheel to react immediately in an emergency. And in this case the driver was distracted. In fact, it was later revealed that the driver was streaming a show on her phone while sitting behind the wheel. That’s the risk with depending on a human driver — they become too reliant on the automated technology to drive itself safely and, in turn, get distracted. To that end, Uber is also ensuring that the automatic emergency braking system that is already built into the car will be engaged no matter when it is being driven. Have more information or any tips?

You can also find her on Twitter at @JmBooyah. These changes come to Uber as the competition for being one of the first companies with a network of self-driving cars — an important feat both technologically and financially — becomes steeper. From a pure miles-driven standpoint, Alphabet’s Waymo announced it had autonomously driven more than eight million miles on public roads just last week. At last count, Uber had only reached three million miles before it halted all of its self-driving testing in March. While the company doesn’t have to start entirely from scratch once it does start testing its autonomous technology again, Uber was struggling to meet internal goals in the lead up to the crash. As we first reported, Uber’s fleet of vehicles could only drive less than a mile before a safety driver had to take over in March 2017. As of March 2018, the company was still struggling to meet its goal of driving 13 miles without a driver taking over. While it was a meager increase from the year prior, it was still far lower than its competitors like Waymo, which said it drove an average of 5,600 miles before a driver had to take over control in 2017. At the core of this issue is safety. Companies building self-driving cars pitch it as a potentially life-saving technology, but those companies still have a lot to prove. That’s especially true as the U.S. Congress actively works to regulate autonomous technology.

"On Sunday, Colombian voters narrowly rejected the government’s peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in a stunning referendum vote that has thrown the peace process into disarray. The deal between the Colombian government and the Marxist rebel group was reached on August 24 after four long years of fraught negotiations. And just last Monday, it was signed by President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC leader Timoleon “Timochenko” Jimenez. All that was left was for voters to approve it in a nationwide referendum on Sunday. Most observers saw the vote as a mere formality that would officially bring an end to the 52-year war that left 220,000 people dead and displaced millions. Although there was significant public opposition to the deal, nearly every poll predicted that it would be approved by the people with a comfortable margin. But in what one UK pollster called “one of the biggest polling fails of all time,” the peace deal was narrowly rejected, with 50.2 percent voting against it. That means the peace agreement can’t be implemented — and is effectively dead. So what happened? And what happens now? Here’s a brief explainer on what Colombia is facing this week. The FARC is the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). It’s a Marxist rebel group that since 1964 has waged a bloody rebellion against the Colombian government — and it’s the longest-running armed insurgency in the Western Hemisphere. As Amanda Taub explained for Vox in 2014: In the early 1960s, the FARC and other leftist guerrilla groups formed as a rural insurgency that claimed to represent the interests of Colombia's poor against the landed elite. The elite responded by organizing private ""self-defense"" organizations to oppose the rebels, which soon transformed into right-wing paramilitary groups. That became the civil war that has lasted ever since, albeit in sometimes very different forms. Since 1964, the FARC, fueled by revenue from the Colombian drug trade, engaged in a guerrilla war primarily against the Colombian security forces. FARC rebels attacked police stations and military posts, ambushed security patrols, hijacked airplanes, and carried out assassinations. They also targeted critical infrastructure such as oil pipelines and bridges, and even bombed social clubs. Many of their victims have been civilians, including children. Thousands of people have been maimed by FARC land mines, and thousands more were kidnapped and held for ransom. Child soldier recruitment and sexual violence were also common. Starting in 2000, the United States began providing the Colombian government with billions of dollars in mostly military aid to help interrupt the country’s massive drug trade and fight the FARC and other smaller rebel groups. The hope was that social and economic conditions in Colombia’s “historically marginalized” rural areas in which the armed groups thrive would also be improved. Under the agreement, called Plan Colombia, the US pledged nearly $10 billion in assistance. As reported by the Washington Post’s Dana Priest, this was paired with “a CIA covert action program that has helped Colombian forces kill at least two dozen rebel leaders.” As far as the FARC is concerned, at least, the plan seems to have worked. (Its impact on the drug trade, on the other hand, is less clear.) The group suffered massive losses, including the deaths of several high-profile leaders. “In 2008, senior rebel leader Raul Reyes was killed in a bombing raid and FARC founder Manuel Marulanda died of natural causes,” the BBC reports. “In 2011, Alfonso Cano, who took over from Manuel Marulanda, was also killed in a bombing raid.” This concerted effort severely weakened the organization: In 2002, the group was estimated to have some 20,000 active fighters; current estimates put that number at somewhere between 6,000 and 7,000 active fighters, with another 8,500 civilians who make up the FARC's support network. In response, the group entered into secret negotiations with the government starting in 2010, and two years later entered into formal negotiations. Finally, in a ceremony on September 26, attended by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, US Secretary of State John Kerry, and a dozen Latin American leaders, Colombian President Santos and FARC leader Timochenko signed the historic peace agreement. Under the 297-page agreement, the FARC’s fighters would have disarmed, handing over weapons to United Nations inspectors, and become a legal political party with 10 guaranteed seats in the country’s Congress in the 2018 and 2022 elections. The deal would also have allowed rebels to avoid jail time if they confessed to their crimes. Per the BBC, the agreement would have created “a special legal framework” intended “to try those who committed crimes during the armed conflict, including Farc fighters, government soldiers and members of right-wing paramilitary groups.” “Those who confessed to crimes” would “not serve prison sentences, but [would instead] take part in acts of ‘reparation,’ including clearing land mines, repairing damaged infrastructure, and helping victims,” the BBC reported. Fighters who demobilized would also receive financial aid from the Colombian government to help them reintegrate into civil society. In the runup to the vote, FARC leaders also offered public apologies to their victims and pledged to publicly disclose all of their financial assets and pay reparations. ""We will proceed to declare before the government all the monetary and non-monetary resources that have formed part of our war economy,” the group said. ""We will proceed to the material reparations of victims."" For its part, the government pledged under the peace agreement to invest substantial resources in improving the country’s rural areas, something the rebels have long been fighting for. According to the Washington Post’s Abbey Steele, measures include providing “development assistance to small-share landholders, who now have trouble getting formal titles to the land they’ve been farming and getting their crops into markets” and offering “rural investments and legal crops so that farmers have fewer incentives to grow illegal crops.” The public’s main objection to the agreement was that it was far too lenient on the FARC fighters, whose war against the Colombian government has ravaged the country for more than half a century. One Colombian woman told BBC Mundo that Colombians still associated the FARC with “kidnappings, killings and drug trafficking.” The leading voice of opposition to the peace deal is former President Alvaro Uribe, who is widely credited with having achieved the military gains that forced the rebels to the negotiating table in the first place. “They will spend zero days in prison; they will be awarded with political representation,” Paloma Valencia, a senator in Uribe’s party, was quoted as saying of the rebels. “This deal breaks the rule of law.” Uribe claims he is not opposed to peace in principle but that he wants to renegotiate the agreement, which he says needs ""corrections."" These include barring those found guilty of having committed crimes from running for public office, making FARC leaders serve time in prison for crimes they committed, and forcing the FARC to pay compensation to victims. According to the BBC, opponents of the deal also feared that allowing former FARC members to participate in the country’s political process as a legitimate political party could open the door to disastrous radical left-wing policies like those in Cuba and Venezuela: They have dubbed this threat ""Castro-Chavismo"" after the Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and the late Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez. They point to the fact that the Cuban government hosted the peace talks and Venezuela acted as a facilitator as evidence of the influence these two left-wing governments had on the negotiations. They have accused President Santos of ""selling the country out"" and warn that with the rebels becoming political players, Colombia could soon resemble Cuba and Venezuela and suffer from the same shortages these countries are experiencing. Finally, some opponents of the peace deal simply didn’t believe that the FARC was sincere in its intentions to lay down arms and make peace with the government. The peace agreement as written cannot be implemented without an approval by referendum, so it will have to be renegotiated. President Santos has promised to “continue the search for peace until the last moment of my mandate, because that's the way to leave a better country to our children ... I won't give up,” he said. Speaking to journalists in Havana after Sunday's referendum results, Timochenko said that his group remains committed to ending the conflict. The rebel leader said he regrets that what he called ""the destructive power of those who sow hatred and rancor [has] influenced the opinion of the Colombian population.” He promised that the group will keep working to build a stable peace: “Count on us, peace will triumph.” However, before the vote, Santos told the BBC that there was ""no Plan B"" for ending the conflict if the referendum on the peace agreement failed. He has reportedly told his negotiators to travel to Cuba to consult with FARC leaders on what the next move will be. Fernando Giraldo, a political analyst, told the Guardian that the fact that both the government and guerrillas reiterated their commitment to peace was a good sign but the future was unclear. “The plebiscite laid everything out in black and white and now we’re stuck in a grey area,” he said.",the-stunning-collapse-of-colombias-peace-agreement-with-the-farc-explained.txt,drew.uq

"Tens of thousands of people will likely die of drug overdoses under President Donald Trump’s watch, as America’s horrific opioid epidemic continues. Yet with his first big policy document — the 2018 budget proposal — Trump is proving that he’ll do little to nothing about the crisis. If anything, Trump’s proposal could make the opioid epidemic worse. Where the budget does anything of significance regarding the epidemic, it comes through cuts to the office in charge of coordinating drug policy, Medicaid, public health programs, and more. And there is nothing in the budget to balance out the cuts — leaving a crater in the government’s response to a crisis that led to more than 33,000 opioid overdose deaths and more than 52,000 total drug overdose deaths in 2015. Drug policy advocates have said for years that the federal government, including the Obama administration, has reacted slowly to the opioid epidemic — given that it took until 2016 for Congress and President Barack Obama to pass any major legislation responding directly to the epidemic, finally adding $1 billion to drug treatment over two years through the 21st Century Cures Act. But advocates argue that the drug overdose crisis will require much more money than that, since it’s now killing more people than guns, cars, and even HIV/AIDS did at its peak. They hoped Trump, who on the campaign trail promised to “end the opioid epidemic in America” and “spend the money” on drug treatment, would bring a bigger commitment. “It would have been easy for Trump to come in and do better than Obama,” said Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University. “But he’s off to an awful start.” It’s not just the budget plan. The spending proposal also fits the pattern we’ve seen with Trump on the opioid epidemic so far: Despite all his talk and promises on the campaign trail, this is an issue in which Trump is doing little to nothing as president — and the little his administration is doing will very likely prove counterproductive. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), Trump’s budget does propose what amounts to a nearly 2 percent increase in drug treatment spending — with an increase of around $200 million to the $10.6 billion the federal government already spent on drug treatment. But there’s a huge catch to this increase: It includes the $500 million added by the 21st Century Cures Act, which was approved by Congress and signed into law by Obama. In other words, without the Cures Act spending that Congress put into place, Trump’s budget would actually cut drug treatment spending this year. In fact, this is what’s very likely to happen the year after Trump’s 2018 budget, since the Cures Act money is allocated only for fiscal years 2017 and 2018. What’s more, the money that is added simply falls far short of what advocates want. Kolodny, for one, estimated that the US will need to spend potentially tens of billions of dollars more a year on the epidemic — far more than Trump or anyone else has put forward. (To this end, he is also highly critical of the Obama administration; he argues it took too long to do anything on the epidemic, and what it did was far too small.) Trump, at the very least, doesn’t propose cutting overall drug treatment spending this year, based on ONDCP’s figures. But he suggests other cuts to public health and anti-drug programs that completely outweigh the tiny gains that ONDCP claims. For one, the budget proposal slashes drug prevention programs across all federal agencies by about 11 percent — from about $1.5 billion to more than $1.3 billion. The budget didn’t, as originally rumored, suggest a 95 percent cut to ONDCP, which is the top office in charge of coordinating anti-drug programs spread through multiple federal agencies. But it does propose cutting some of the office’s programs by a few percentage points. Some drug policy advocates see ONDCP as somewhat problematic, given its history of supporting ineffective “tough on drug” policies. But they argue the office should be reformed and propped up to lead the response to the opioid epidemic, not cut back. Kolodny agreed. He said, “There are things that ONDCP can do. Certainly, in the midst of this epidemic … cutting funding to an office that can play a role in coordinating a response is foolish. [Trump] should be looking in different ways to be finding more money for the opioid crisis, not cutting ONDCP.” Trump also proposes a 47 percent cut to Medicaid over the next 10 years. This would rob millions of people of the one affordable source of health insurance that they have — to pay for, in part, drug treatment. According to a 2014 study by Truven Health Analytics researchers, Medicaid paid for a quarter, or $7.9 billion of $31.3 billion, of projected public and private spending for drug treatment in 2014. As a patient using Medicaid to pay for drug addiction care at a New Jersey facility told me earlier this year, “If it wasn’t for insurance, I wouldn’t be here.” The budget further asks for nearly $400 million in cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, hundreds of millions in cuts to mental health block grants, and billions in cuts altogether to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This funding didn’t all go specifically to drug treatment, but these agencies and programs in part help address the opioid epidemic and drug addiction in general. Advocates are already sounding the alarm over these cuts. The Baltimore City Health Department, for example, said in a statement, “At a time of a public health emergency around opioids, with unprecedented numbers of Marylanders dying from overdose, this proposal could deprive millions of the care that they need.” Finally, the budget significantly increases overall spending on federal law enforcement. It’s unclear exactly how much of this will go toward fighting drugs. But generally, drug policy experts and researchers agree that what’s needed is not more policing but more spending on drug treatment. After all, the US has spent hundreds of billions on anti-drug law enforcement for decades — and it didn’t prevent the opioid epidemic. The budget proposal is likely dead on arrival. It needs Congress’s approval to become law, and Congress will likely put forward its own spending measures instead of using Trump’s. But the budget plan is still the most comprehensive policy agenda that we can expect from the Trump administration at this point — and it shows a total lack of interest in seriously addressing the opioid epidemic. The rest of Trump’s opioid policy isn’t much better. Generally, it can be described as the opposite of what Trump said on the campaign trail — instead of allocating more funding to deal with the epidemic as a public health issue, he’s often undercutting such efforts. Beyond his budget proposal, here’s a broad rundown of what the Trump administration has said and done on opioids since Trump took office: The only concrete action on this list is Sessions’s memo, which doubled down on the old war on drugs. But the research suggests that this “tough on crime” approach — focused on increasing criminal penalties for drugs to, hopefully, deter drug use — just won’t work. For example, a 2014 study from Peter Reuter at the University of Maryland and Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago found there’s no good evidence that tougher punishments or harsher supply-elimination efforts do a better job of driving down access to drugs and substance misuse than lighter penalties. So increasing the severity of the punishment doesn’t seem to do much, if anything, to slow the flow of drugs. Similarly, a 2015 review of the research by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that more incarceration explained only about 0 to 7 percent of the crime drop since the 1990s, while other researchers estimate it drove 10 to 25 percent of the crime drop since the ’90s. That’s why criminal justice experts now emphasize that there are better ways, from new policing tactics to more stringent alcohol policies, to bring down crime without resorting to longer prison sentences. The punitive criminalization of drugs is also sometimes a reason that drug users don’t seek care. Reporter Maia Szalavitz, who’s covered addiction for decades, has long argued that criminalization just leads to stigma, which pushes drug users underground. And a 2009 report by the libertarian Cato Institute found that after Portugal decriminalized all drugs, more drug users sought treatment because the policy change removed the fear of arrest and the stigma attached to it. At the same time, Trump has, if anything, vowed to reduce funding on opioid addiction care through his budget cuts — contradicting his campaign promise to “spend the money” on drug treatment. The fundamental problem in the opioid crisis is that America needs to put a lot more resources toward drug addiction prevention and treatment. In 2016, the surgeon general released the most comprehensive analysis of the state of addiction in America. Its core finding was that the US massively underfunds addiction care. It found, for example, that just 10 percent of Americans with a drug use disorder get specialty treatment, in large part due to a shortage in treatment options. The Obama administration took some steps to alleviate this. It dedicated $2.5 million in 2015 to fight heroin use. Its Department of Health and Human Services also unlocked more than $100 million for drug treatment in 2016. And Congress in 2016, with Obama’s approval, allocated $1 billion over two years to combat the opioid epidemic. But experts widely agree that this all was far, far from enough. They have hoped that Trump would do more, given that some of his biggest areas of support are places that have been hit hardest by the opioid epidemic. “We need a massive increase in funding for addiction treatment,” Kolodny argued. “We’re not going to get anywhere in terms of reducing overdose deaths until you have very low threshold access to buprenorphine treatment or methadone in some cases” — referring to two medications used for treating opioid addiction. Beyond drug treatment, the federal government could do more to stop doctors from prescribing so many opioid painkillers, whose overprescription launched the epidemic. The FDA, for example, could limit how drug companies promote opioids, forcing them to follow CDC recommendations to not use the drugs for chronic non-cancer pain. (There is no good scientific evidence for the use of opioids for chronic pain, while there’s plenty of evidence that prolonged use can result in very bad complications, including a higher risk of addiction, overdose, and death.) Instead of doing any of this, Trump has proposed cutting public health programs and Medicaid, and he’s pushed to repeal Obamacare without a replacement that would cover Americans’ health insurance needs. More broadly, Trump has done nothing to address the structural issues behind drug addiction — the poverty, joblessness, deteriorating communities, and other common contributors to despair that lead to drug addiction. “If you look at overall public health trends, there are a lot of things like alcohol use and suicide that have increased in concert with opioid use,” said Leo Beletsky, a professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University. “That speaks to underlying, larger problems.” It’s not unusual for Trump to make a promise and do the opposite. But in this case, people’s lives are quite literally at stake — and his administration is at best dawdling and at worst taking steps that will make a very deadly crisis even deadlier.",trumps-budget-makes-it-official-hes-doing-little-to-nothing-about-the-opioid-epidemic.txt,drew.uq
"KABUL (Reuters) - Russia has rejected comments by NATO’s top commander in Afghanistan that it has been supporting and even supplying weapons to the Taliban, in a clash of words that underlines growing tension over Moscow’s involvement in the conflict.  In an interview with the BBC last week, General John Nicholson said that Russia had been acting to undermine U.S. efforts in Afghanistan despite shared interests in fighting terrorism and narcotics, with indications that Moscow was providing financial support and even arms.  “We’ve had weapons brought to this headquarters and given to us by Afghan leaders and said this was given by the Russians to the Taliban,” he said.  A statement from the Russian embassy in Kabul dismissed the comments as “idle gossip”, repeating previous denials by Russian officials.  “Once again, we insist that such statements are absolutely baseless and appeal to officials not to talk nonsense,” the embassy said.  U.S. commanders, including Nicholson, have said on several occasions over the past year that Russia may be supplying arms to the Taliban although no confirmed evidence has so far been made public.  However, Nicholson’s comments were unusually blunt and came in a context of growing tensions between NATO members and Moscow over the case of Sergei Skripal, a former intelligence agent found poisoned with a rare nerve agent in Britain.  Russian officials have said that their limited contacts with the Taliban were aimed at encouraging peace talks and ensuring the safety of Russian citizens. Moscow has offered to help coordinate peace talks in Afghanistan.  Taliban officials have told Reuters that the group has had significant contacts with Moscow since at least 2007, adding that Russian involvement did not extend beyond “moral and political support”.  Moscow has been critical of the United States and NATO over their handling of the war in Afghanistan, but Russia initially helped provide helicopters for the Afghan military and agreed to a supply route for coalition materials through Russia.  Most of that cooperation has fallen apart as relations between Russia and the West deteriorated in recent years over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.

"The Academy Awards are just a few days away, and amid the excitement is some vocal frustration at the fact that the films and people being recognized are, once again, overwhelmingly white and male. It's a well-documented problem not just in the Academy but in Hollywood overall — and the brilliant Tumblr Every Single Word found a creative way to illustrate the severity of the issue. Created by 27-year-old Venezuelan American actor and playwright Dylan Marron, Every Single Word shows what Hollywood films would look like if they were condensed to just the lines spoken by minorities over the course of their run times. As it turns out, many would be much more like Vine videos than feature-length films. Marron was fed up with hearing that as a nonwhite actor he was ""never going to play the romantic male lead,"" as he told the Washington Post's Soraya Nadia McDonald in an interview in July 2015, so he set out to show just how few minorities are playing lead parts in Hollywood. Take, for instance, American Hustle, which was nominated for 10 Oscars in 2015 — Marron's minorities-only cut comes in at 53 seconds: Or critical darling Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom, which clocks in at an anemic 10 seconds: Or the 2014 Biblical epic Noah, coming in at ... zero: To the Post's McDonald, Marron explained how he picks the movies he features on his Tumblr: There’s a big variety of movies, but they do have one thing in common: all of these movies are not about whiteness. They are not about white people. They are not about the experience of being white and they are not historical dramas that are just about white people. They’re not about whiteness. They are about really universal and very human themes. He continued: So my question with these videos is why are we using white people to tell these universal stories? And what is that saying? I think it’s saying something really dangerous and the message it gives to people of color — and I can say this as a person of color who grew up watching these stories that I related to thematically and didn’t see reflections of myself in them — what it tells you is you don’t really have a place in this world. The idea of white as the ""normal"" is longstanding, pervasive, and ties into the concept of implicit bias that manifests itself in American society in areas as widespread as criminal justice and education. One area in which diversity has seen an uptick recently is in television: Shows like ABC’s Black-ish and Fresh Off the Boat and the ratings behemoth that was the first season of Fox’s Empire proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that not only is there an audience for series centered on nonwhite characters, but that they have the potential to be hugely successful. However, there's also the Mindy Kaling–created The Mindy Project, the first network TV series created by and starring an Indian American (and a woman, no less), which has been criticized for not having enough focus on the lead's ethnicity — or as Al Jazeera's E. Alex Chung phrased it, ""Almost any exchange [Kaling's character Mindy] Lahiri has about race appears meant to prove that she is not one of the others but a full-blooded American."" But while television is making strides toward diversity, the silver screen still notably lags behind. In its 2015 Hollywood Diversity Report, UCLA's Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies found that ""[a]lthough minorities posted several modest gains in several Hollywood employment arenas since the last report, they remain underrepresented on every front."" The report examined the top 200 theatrical releases from both 2012 and 2013, and found that minorities, who comprise 40 percent of the US population, were sorely underrepresented as male leads: Ralph J. Bunche Center As cast members: Ralph J. Bunche Center And as directors: Ralph J. Bunche Center The Comprehensive Annenberg Report on Diversity, from the Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative at USC's Annenberg School, found that of 414 films and TV series studied, women had only one-third of the speaking roles and minorities just 28.3 percent. And the lack of diversity is not just for lack of effort; as the Washington Post's Alyssa Rosenberg pointed out in a May 2015 piece aptly titled ""How Hollywood stays white and male"": the same laws that protect against employment discrimination also block certain efforts to hire more women and people of color. Networks can set goals for how many female writers they want to hire, or how many characters of color they want to see on screen, but they can’t legally use quotas to reach those goals. Marron's Tumblr serves to point out that while show biz may be improving in some areas, its diversity problem is far from ""fixed."" And he summed up that impact on this year's Oscars succinctly:",hollywoods-extreme-lack-of-diversity-explained-by-a-brilliant-tumblr.txt,drew.uq
"Originally published on Grist. What kind of person doesn’t believe climate change is a problem? What kind of person does? Behold, a new set of answers to this thorny social science question, released earlier this week in the journal Nature Climate Change. Or rather, a whole lot of old answers, derived from data assembled over the past eight years: 12 Pew surveys, three British polls collected by the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change, an International Social Survey conducted across 32 countries, eight Australian polls, and the Eurobarometer (the thoughts of 30 European nations, gathered by the European Commission). The paper’s authors describe their work as ""the first meta-analytic examination of the demographic and psychological correlates of belief in climate change."" So what did they find out? And it matters more than anyone harboring idealistic notions of working across the aisle might think. It breaks down this way: People who vote for liberal political parties are more likely to believe that climate change is a real thing that we should do something about. People who vote for conservative political parties tend to think that climate change is total hooey. Political affiliation correlated with belief in climate change twice as strongly as any other demographic variable the study examined. There are a whole lot of other ways of thinking of climate change beyond the binary ""it is/isn’t happening"" (like: climate change is real, but actually good for us). But in this meta-analysis, the study’s authors didn’t find much of a middle ground when they looked at all the studies in aggregate. This led them to hypothesize that, on average, belief (or lack of belief) in climate change correlates with political affiliation rather than with some other complex intellectual process that might only have a little bit to do with politics. This meta-analysis looked at data collected from all over the world and found that, planet-wise, people who believed that climate change is happening tended to be younger, more educated, higher-income, female, and less white — but that, again, none of these factors correlated with belief in the reality of climate change as strongly as political affiliation. Early studies showed that people who believed in climate change and people who didn’t had roughly equivalent levels of scientific understanding. Those studies have been called into question, because they basically let people self-report their awesomeness at understanding science. Later studies have tried to control for that with a few actual science questions, and the meta-analysis did find that people who answered science questions correctly were more likely to believe in climate change. Also: Just liking scientists and thinking that they’re trustworthy was correlated with belief in climate change, whether or not scientific understanding was high. A test called the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) is the tool social scientists commonly use to attempt to quantify concern for the environment. (Test takers agree or disagree with statements like, ""Plants and animals have as much right as humans to exist."") Unsurprisingly, people who score high for environmental concern on the NEP also tend to believe in climate change. There’s no way of knowing yet if this is a trickle-down effect from the government action or a trickle-up effect from the people in those countries demanding that the government do something. As the study puts it: A set of experimental studies have drawn on the social psychological literature on subliminal priming to examine whether priming people with environmental cues of climate change (for example, turning up the heat in the laboratory; placing dead trees around participants) has an effect on their belief in climate change. The observed link between these inductions and climate change belief are significant, perhaps surprisingly so given their impact is unconscious. So Ayn Rand probably wouldn’t have been a big climate activist. People who are fans of free markets also tended to not believe in climate change. So what is someone interested in talking with people about climate change to do with all this information? I mean, aside from locking the entire world in a hot room with a bunch of dead trees? The study’s authors recommend this: Remember that climate change, whether you like it or not, is a political issue. As they put it, ""The data suggest that evidence around climate change is searched, remembered, and assimilated in a way that dovetails with people’s own political loyalties and worldviews."" They also found that even people who believed in climate change grew skittish when talk turned to specific policies to mitigate it. In other words, it might be time for the social sciences as they relate to climate change to move beyond the question of who thinks climate change is real and more in the direction of why people feel the way they do. Actually getting things done could focus less on winning hearts and minds and more on working with people’s existing ideologies, rather than against them. As the study puts it, ""Pro-environmental action could be sold as patriotism, ending oil dependence, or investing in ‘green’ technologies.""

"GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli troops shot dead three protesters along the Gaza border on Friday, Gaza medics said, hours after the United Nations human rights chief criticized Israel for using “excessive force” against demonstrators.   Israeli troops have killed 41 Palestinians and wounded more than 5,000 others since Gaza residents began staging protests along the border fence on March 30 to demand the right of return for Palestinian refugees.  The troops were holed up behind fortifications on their side of the 40km (25-mile) border fence and fired live ammunition and tear gas at protesters at five locations on the Gazan side.   Gaza medical officials said two protesters who were struck by bullets were in critical condition in hospital and 600 others were wounded.  The Israeli military said 12,000-14,000 Gazans were participating in what it described as “riots,” and that some had tried to breach the border into Israel. It said troops “had operated in accordance with the rules of engagement” to stop people crossing the border.   The Gaza health ministry said 200 were wounded by gun fire, including a Palestinian journalist who was hit in the foot by a bullet.  Dozens more, including four medics, were treated for gas inhalation, as Israeli forces showered the area with tear gas canisters from behind their fortifications in Israel.   Protesters hurled stones and rolled burning tires toward the fence, and some attached cans of burning petrol to kites and flew them into Israeli territory.  Others cleared away barbed wire coils which Israeli troops had placed in Gazan territory overnight in a bid to create a buffer zone between protesters and the fence.  After dark, the Israeli military said in a statement that its fighter jets had struck six targets belonging to Hamas’ naval force “in response to the terror activity and mass attempt to infiltrate into Israeli territory earlier today.”  Hamas said two boats moored off the Gaza shore were hit, causing damage, but that no casualties were reported.   The protests come at a time of growing frustration for Palestinians as prospects for an independent Palestinian state look poor. Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been stalled for several years and Israeli settlements in the occupied territories have expanded.   In a statement, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein called the loss of life deplorable and said a “staggering number” of injuries had been caused by live ammunition.  Israel’s foreign ministry had no immediate comment but the government has consistently said it is protecting its borders and that its troops are following rules of engagement.  Israel’s U.N. envoy, Danny Danon, told the Security Council on Thursday that Hamas in Gaza was responsible for Palestinian casualties and that it was using innocent Palestinian women and children as human shields.   “The terrorists are hiding while allowing, even hoping, for their people to die. This is evil in its purest form,” he said.  Hamas denies the Israeli accusations. “Danon’s comments are an attempt to escape responsibility and to cover up for the execution of unarmed children and people by occupation soldiers,” said Hamas official Mushir Al-Masri.  Named the ‘Great March of Return’, the protest action revives a longstanding demand for the right of return of Palestinian refugees to towns and villages which their families fled from, or were driven out of, when the state of Israel was created in 1948. Israel refuses any right of return, fearing that the country would lose its Jewish majority.  More than 2 million Palestinians are packed into the narrow coastal enclave. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains tight control of its land and sea borders. Egypt also restricts movement in and out of Gaza on its border.

"On Wednesday afternoon, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called Donald Trump to talk about working together in the future. The Pakistani government then released what’s called a “readout,” which is usually a fairly boring summary of a call between world leaders. Only this one … well, it’s not boring. It reads more like a transcript of actual things Trump said to Sharif, and those things are amazing. Here’s the readout in full: Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif called President-elect USA Donald Trump and felicitated him on his victory. President Trump said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif you have a very good reputation. You are a terrific guy. You are doing amazing work which is visible in every way. I am looking forward to see you soon. As I am talking to you Prime Minister, I feel I am talking to a person I have known for long. Your country is amazing with tremendous opportunities. Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people. I am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems. It will be an honor and I will personally do it. Feel free to call me any time even before 20th January that is before I assume my office. On being invited to visit Pakistan by the Prime Minister, Mr. Trump said that he would love to come to a fantastic country, fantastic place of fantastic people. Please convey to the Pakistani people that they are amazing and all Pakistanis I have known are exceptional people, said Mr. Donald Trump. Obviously, these could just be paraphrases, but the quotes just sound so much like Trump. It’s hard to imagine some Pakistani bureaucrat making up Trumpy lines like “Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people” — which, come to think of it, begs the question of who the least intelligent people are. Also, it’s worth noting that these “most intelligent people” would be blocked from entering the United States under Trump’s “Muslim ban.” We’ve reached out to the Trump team and the Pakistani government to confirm whether these are actual quotes or just truly inspired paraphrasing.",the-pakistani-government-released-a-readout-of-its-call-with-trump-its-magical.txt,drew.uq
"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone could have an instant payments system shared by all banks in the bloc by the end of 2020, finance industry officials said, as lenders face more competition from the likes of Facebook and other tech firms.   Real-time payments have been possible in the 19-country currency bloc since 2017, but only about half of the euro zone’s banks have joined the scheme that underpins these transactions  and it is mostly used for domestic payments.  The project could now accelerate as banks feel the heat of new competitors like Facebook, which last week unveiled plans for a cryptocurrency that would offer seamless payments to its users worldwide.  “The clock is ticking,” said Etienne Goosse, director general of the European Payments Council (EPC), that brings together large European banks, including Spain’s Santander, Deutsche Bank and France’s Societe Generale.  Goosse said that regardless of Facebook’s success with its move into payments, big technology firms were here to stay and banks needed to move more quickly.  He said the big tech firms had the advantage of being global unlike the fragmented European banking industry.  “They come with a global solution, under a global brand offering many things that the consumers seem to find wonderful,” Goosse said when asked about the impact of Facebook’s plans for crypto currency Libra.  “So we have no time.”  The EPC standard for instant payments has so far been adopted by some 60% of lenders and payment services providers in the euro zone, Goosse said, adding that it could be spread to all banks in the bloc by the end of 2020.  Without full coverage, some bank customers could experience transaction failures if transfers involve banks outside the system, which would reduce trust in the new service, another EPC official said.  Instant payments allow transactions between individuals and businesses to complete in a matter of seconds. Traditional transfers take at least one day before the payment is credited.  Other industry officials confirmed that 2020 was a credible target. But for the system to work across borders existing clearing and settlement mechanisms should cover the whole euro zone. These mechanisms make sure money is correctly transferred between parties.  Several private clearing houses use the EPC standard for instant payments like EBA Clearing, which brings together Europe’s largest banks, or national counterparties like Spain’s Iberpay or Italy’s Nexi.   The European Central Bank in November launched its own settlement system for real-time transactions, known as TIPS, which stands for Target Instant Payment Settlement.  But each of these different systems cover only a few dozen banks, making instant payments often impossible among lenders that are not members of the same clearing houses.  “The challenge now is to make these mechanisms interoperable,” said Piet Mallekoote, the CEO of the Dutch Payment Association. The Netherlands has already made instant payments available to all bank customers in the country via a project backed by seven major domestic banks, including ING and ABN AMRO.   But even if a payments system is rolled out across the euro zone this may not be enough to attract customers away from  fintech providers with easy to use apps.  Facebook can already tap into its established social media and chat services, but banks would need to agree on applications like mobile payments or use customers’ existing payment cards to convince them to use banks’ instant payment services.

"The Trump administration has, quite brazenly, moved into Obamacare sabotage mode — hurting the most vulnerable participants as it puts the law itself at risk. Health and Human Services announced Thursday it would cut the Obamacare sign-up budget by 72 percent. Advertising funding will fall from $100 million to $10 million for the 2018 enrollment season. In-person outreach dollars will decline from $62.5 million to $36 million. The Affordable Care Act’s success hinges on a large number of healthy people enrolling in marketplace coverage. These policy changes only make senses as ones that would undermine that goal. Experts expect that less outreach and less advertising will lead to fewer people enrolling in coverage, and those most likely to be left behind are the young, healthy enrollees who hold down premiums for everyone else. Those in-person outreach efforts also ensure that vulnerable populations, like those that don’t speak English or lack internet access, can still enroll. Instead of making Obamacare more robust and inclusive, they’re setting the law up to fail. Fewer people know about the opportunity to enroll when advertising falls by 90 percent. We know that, in part, because sign-ups fell off when the Trump administration pulled Obamacare ads in late January, shortly after taking office. In-person enrollment groups are preparing to lay off staffs; one has already begun to furlough workers after learning of the budget cuts. The likely outcome is that the marketplaces will be made up of people who remember to sign up are on their own. Those people are expected to be sicker — people who really need insurance — meaning premiums will rise for all Obamacare enrollees in 2019. Trump administration officials offered flimsy justifications for the budget cuts. Public awareness is already high, they said, in making the case for a 90 percent reduction in advertising — ignoring data suggesting that 40 percent of the remaining uninsured are unaware of the marketplace and its enrollment period. The Trump administration plans to penalize in-person enrollment groups that have fallen below their sign-up goals. It will not, however, reward those that have exceeded expectations. “That is not part of the methodology,” one HHS official said. Obamacare advocates have, for months, worried about subtle forms of sabotage that would be difficult to spot — not staffing the Healthcare.gov call center appropriately, for example, or not rushing to fix technical glitches on the website. Most did not expect such a brazen and significant cut to the enrollment budget. They don’t expect Obamacare can keep up its enrollment numbers with such a significant budget cut. “I see us either having to reduce staff or leverage funding somewhere else,” says Randal Serr, director of Take Care Utah. “It’s a pretty strange time for us.” The Affordable Care Act requires the federal government to run a “navigator program,” that provides grants to local nonprofits and health care organizations to increase awareness of the law, enroll consumers in coverage, and troubleshoot issues they have with their new coverage. The Obama administration had given the program between $60 and $67 million annually over last four years. The Trump administration will provide $36 million next year, a 41 percent cut. The navigator program cuts will likely hurt the most vulnerable Obamacare enrollees, those who needed extra assistance to become enrolled in coverage. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 79 percent of Obamacare enrollees who sign up with in-person help do so because they “lack confidence to apply on their own.” Seventy-seven person say they need help understanding plan choices, and 31 percent lack internet service at home. One navigator program I covered recently, in Detroit, focuses on signing up Arab-American refugees who face language barriers while attempting to enroll in coverage — and, in many cases, are unaware the Affordable Care Act even existed. Another, in Kentucky, works with populations that are often enrolling in coverage for the first time. Trump officials explained that they will use “enrollment targets” that each navigator group set for themselves to distribute the funding cuts. A navigator group that only signed up 40 percent of its enrollment target, for example, will only receive 40 percent of last year’s funding. This will cut the program’s funding by an estimated $23 million. These enrollment targets are a suspicious metric to use for budgets. For one thing, they are set by the navigators themselves. This means that a group that lowballed their estimates is rewarded — while a nonprofit that set an ambitious goal gets penalized. These two groups might have done equally good work signing people up for coverage; the only difference is where they set their goals. Navigators say the Obama administration repeatedly encouraged them to set high goals as a motivator. They had no idea these numbers would become part of the funding scheme. “CMS was telling us set high goals and even if you don’t hit those goals, we want to aim to help as many people as possible,” says Serr from Utah. In-person enrollments are only one part of the navigator program’s mission. Much of the group’s time is spent answering questions over the phone, attending community events to raise awareness, and helping new enrollees understand their coverage after they sign up. The Palmetto Project in South Carolina, for example, operates in a largely rural area of the state that had low rates of insurance before the health law started. The group has directly signed 1,900 people up for marketplace coverage this year — but has also answered 24,000 inquiries about health law coverage in the same time frame. It has signed up many Medicaid enrollees too, but Quenga’s understanding is that those enrollments will not be counted in the new funding formula. “If our legal responsibility was simply to enroll, I might cave and be a bit more sympathetic,” says Quenga. “But we have five different responsibilities, and enrolling is only one of them. Outreach and education is a huge piece. You don’t get enrollments from teaching people to use their insurance.” When asked why they selected this metric, a Health and Human Services official said, “for the upcoming enrollment period, we are making funding decisions based on the facts and the principle of accountability.” Navigator groups have, for months now, said their grants would stay roughly the same in 2018, say Health and Human Services officials. They made plans based on those predictions: rented office space and started buying advertisements for the open enrollment season, which begins on November 1. Now, they’re not sure if they can afford that spending. “We’ve already started buying advertising, trying to sign contracts for the offices for our staff, we’re working with school superintendents to make flyers to go home with the kids in our districts,” says Kelly Allen, a navigator in West Virginia. “I don’t know if CMS has a good poker face or what.” “We’ve been moving forward as if nothing was going to change because we didn’t have much of another option,” says Serr. “I see us either having to reduce staff or leverage new funding. It’s a strange time.” The Trump administration also announced on Thursday that it will cut spending on advertising by 90 percent, paring back the Obama administration’s $100 million budget to a paltry $10 million. The type of advertising will change, too. The Obama administration often ran television and radio campaigns meant to reach a wide range of Americans who might consider purchasing coverage. The Trump administration has said it will focus on digital advertising, which is expected to take the form of reminder emails and texts to those who have already signed up for coverage. Obama administration officials like Lori Lodes, who previously ran health law outreach, said that television ads were the most effective way to run Obamacare outreach — and that the Trump administration has zeroed out that budget. They are spending ZERO dollars on TV ads. Despite having PROOF that it is the biggest driver of enrollment. In any case, $10 million is a very small number — especially when the administration is also putting out ads criticizing the Affordable Care Act, too. To put it in context, California is planning to spend $111.5 million on advertising in its state alone. The federal government will spend one-tenth of that in the 34 states where it runs the state health insurance marketplace. Trump had already spent twice as much on his own private travel by April of this year. HHS administration officials claimed they made this change because public awareness of the health care law is high, which means less advertising is needed. “People are aware of Obamacare and the exchanges, they are aware they can sign up,” an HHS official said. “The Obama administration doubled spending on advertising and saw a 5 percent decline in enrollment. Despite a doubled budget, there are diminishing returns.” The decline in health law enrollment, however, occurred in late January, around the moment the Trump administration abruptly canceled $5 million in advertisements after taking office. When pressed by a reporter, officials said they had not done any studies of the efficacy of enrollment advertising or whether public awareness is indeed quite high. “We haven’t done a specific study related to the public awareness of the program,” the third HHS official said. “I think most Americans are aware of the program at this point in time.” The research that has been done, however, suggests that public awareness of the health care law is not especially high among the uninsured — and that advertising does work to increase it. A Commonwealth Fund study from last year found that 38 percent of Americans who remain uninsured are unaware of the health law marketplaces. That number has declined slowly, year over year, but certainly has a way to go before all Americans are “aware they can sign up.” There is not a large body of research on Affordable Care Act advertising, but what has been done correlates more advertising with higher sign-up rates. A 2017 study published in the journal Health Affairs shows that “counties exposed to higher volumes of local insurance advertisements during the first open enrollment period experienced larger reductions in their uninsurance rates than other counties.” Trump administration officials said that this new $10 million budget would bring Obamacare’s advertising spending in line with what the agency puts toward the Medicare program. But that doesn’t make much sense: Medicare is a program that has been around for 60 years, one that is well-established. Obamacare has been around for five. The Trump administration will advertise Obamacare less — and give enrollees a shorter time frame for enrollment. Unlike last year, where open enrollment ran from November 1 through January 31, this year’s open enrollment period will start November 1 and end December 15. Enrollees will get 45 days to sign up for coverage instead of 90. “The shorter open enrollment is one of my bigger concerns,” says Jodi Ray, director of Florida Covering Kids and Families, which runs the state’s largest navigator grant. “That’s going to surprise a lot of our customers. We’re reaching out to people, we’re calling anyone who has contact with our project over the past few years, to let them know.” A shorter open enrollment period coupled with less advertising and less in-person support will near certainly lead to fewer people signing up for Obamacare. The people most likely left behind fall into two categories: Obamacare’s healthy enrollees and its most vulnerable. Experts expect that people who really need health insurance — those with expensive medical conditions — will make sure they enroll in coverage. These are the consumers who are likely to check open enrollment dates and remember to sign up in time. Research from Yale health economist Amanda Kowalski has found that states that had significant technical glitches during the health law’s first open enrollment period ended up with a sicker set of Obamacare enrollees, suggesting that that population was more persistent in seeking coverage. A sicker Obamacare enrollee population will drive up premiums for anyone who wants to sign up for coverage in the future. In 2019, you’d expect insurance companies to set higher premiums to account for those higher medical bills. Cutting ACA outreach will result in fewer people insured, and those who fail to sign up will be the healthiest. That will push premiums up. But there are some Obamacare enrollees with significant health care needs who won’t sign up for coverage. These are the vulnerable populations that rely on in-person Obamacare assistance, the program that will lose 40 percent of its budget next year. This might be the refugee I profiled in Detroit, who doesn’t speak English well enough to navigate the health care system. She relies on her health coverage for multiple medical conditions, some the result of trauma endured before immigrating to the US from Iraq. It might include the 20-year-old dishwasher I met in Kentucky who relies on his health law coverage to get prescriptions for his ADHD — who only found out that he was eligible for a plan because the local outreach group held an enrollment event at the restaurant where he works. The result of less Obamacare outreach and advertising is leaving behind these two populations: a healthy population that makes the marketplace work, and a sicker population that doesn’t necessarily know how to navigate the system without help.

"What happened after Portugal decriminalized all drugs, from weed to heroin.  What happened after Portugal decriminalized all drugs, from weed to heroin.  As diplomats gather at the United Nations in New York this week to consider the future of global drug policy, one Portuguese official, João Goulão, will likely command attention that far outstrips his country’s influence in practically any other area. That’s because 16 years ago, Portugal took a leap and decriminalized the possession of all drugs — everything from marijuana to heroin. By most measures, the move has paid off. Today, Portuguese authorities don’t arrest anyone found holding what’s considered less than a 10-day supply of an illicit drug — a gram of heroin, ecstasy, or amphetamine, two grams of cocaine, or 25 grams of cannabis. Instead, drug offenders receive a citation and are ordered to appear before so- called “dissuasion panels” made up of legal, social, and psychological experts. Most cases are simply suspended. Individuals who repeatedly come before the panels may be prescribed treatment, ranging from motivational counseling to opiate substitution therapy. “We had a lot of criticism at first,” recalled Goulão, a physician specializing in addiction treatment whose work led Portugal to reform its drug laws in 2000, and who is today its national drug coordinator. After decriminalizing, the first inquiries Portugal received from the International Narcotics Control Board — the quasi-judicial UN oversight body established by the UN drug convention system — were sharp and scolding. “Now things have changed completely,” he went on. “We are pointed to as an example of best practices inside the spirit of the conventions.” Indeed, Werner Sipp, the new head of the board, said as much at the UN’s Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna earlier this year. ‘It was the combination of the law and these services that made it a success. It’s very difficult to find people in Portugal who disagree with this model.’ As diplomats gather at the United Nations in New York this week to consider the future of global drug policy, one Portuguese official, João Goulão, will likely command attention that far outstrips his country’s influence in practically any other area.

It’s very difficult to find people in Portugal who disagree with this model.’ Though often narrowly assessed in reference to its decriminalization law, Portugal’s experience over the last decade and a half speaks as much to its free public health system, extensive treatment programs, and the hard to quantify trickle down effects of the legislation. In a society where drugs are less stigmatized, problem users are more likely to seek out care. Police, even if they suspect someone of using drugs, are less likely to bother them. Though at least 25 countries have introduced some form of decriminalization, Portugal’s holistic model and its use of dissuasion panels sets it apart. The rate of new HIV infections in Portugal has fallen precipitously since 2001, the year its law took effect, declining from 1,016 cases to only 56 in 2012. Overdose deaths decreased from 80 the year that decriminalization was enacted to only 16 in 2012. In the US, by comparison, more than 14,000 people died in 2014 from prescription opioid overdoses alone. Portugal’s current drug-induced death rate, three per million residents, is more than five times lower than the European Union’s average of 17.3, according to EU figures. When Portugal decided to decriminalize in 2000, many skeptics assumed that the number of users would skyrocket. That did not happen. With some exceptions, including a marginal increase among adolescents, drug use has fallen over the past 15 years and now ebbs and flows within overall trends in Europe. Portuguese officials estimate that by the late 1990s roughly one percent of Portugal’s population, around 100,000 people, were heroin users. Today, “we estimate that we have 50,000, most of them under substitution treatment,” said Goulão before adding that he’s recently seen a small uptick in use of the drug, predominantly among former addicts that got clean. This reflects Portugal’s tenuous economic condition, he contends. “People use drugs for one of two reasons — either to potentiate pleasures or relieve unpleasure — and the types of drugs and the type of people who use drugs carries a lot according to the conditions of life in the country,” he remarked. Parallel harm reduction measures, such as needle exchanges and opioid substitution therapy using drugs like methadone and buprenorphine, he said, serve as a cushion to prevent the spread of communicable diseases and a rise in overdoses even if the number of users injecting heroin happens to increase for a period of time. “I think harm reduction is not giving up on people,” said Goulão. “I think it is respecting their timings and assuming that even if someone is still using drugs, that person deserves the investment of the state in order to have a better and longer life.” Such statements, once considered radical, are becoming more appealing to drug officials in other countries. Decriminalization and harm reduction lends greater attention to the human rights of users while allowing law enforcement resources to be spent elsewhere. And though it’s a major shift, Portuguese decriminalization is not a revolution in terms of international law. Drugs are still illegal in Portugal, drug dealers and traffickers are still sent to jail, and the country has carefully kept itself within the confines of the UN’s drug convention system that inform national drug laws. For decades the three treaties were seen as prescribing jail time for users, but experts have long contended — and governments now increasingly recognize — that they give countries wide latitude in how to treat and police users. When Portugal decriminalized, UN member states were just years removed from a 1998 special session of the General Assembly that convened under the fanciful pretext of eliminating drug use worldwide. On Tuesday, member states adopted a new outcome document that is meant to reposition drug policy. It stops short of what many advocates would have liked, excluding the actual words “harm reduction” while failing to address the death penalty for drug offenders, which member states noted repeatedly on Tuesday. The document reflects both an evolution in drug policy in many parts of the world over the last two decades, but is also a testament to the continued influence of conservative countries that still favor interdiction. Goulão himself is skeptical of some aspects of marijuana reform in places like the United States, which he says can conflate medical use with recreational markets. “Sometimes I feel the promoters of this discussion are mixing things together using a lack of intellectual seriousness,” he said. Though heroin use is often highlighted to show the efficacy of Portugal’s model, today most users that come before panels are in fact caught with either hashish or cannabis, said Nuno Capaz, a sociologist who serves on Lisbon’s dissuasion panel. Between 80 to 85 percent of all people who report to the panels are first-time offenders and deemed to be recreational users, meaning their cases are suspended. For those who have been repeatedly caught or are identified as addicts, the panels can order sanctions or treatment. Recreational users may face fines or be ordered to provide community service. If an addict refuses treatment, they are required to check in regularly with their “family doctor” — the medical professional in the person’s locality that provides checkups and other services to them under Portugal’s free national healthcare program. Such a close, pre-existing relationship between medical professionals and Portuguese residents is another feature of the model, and one that could be hard to replicate in a country like the US. “If the person doesn’t show up at the doctor, we ask the police to personally hand them a notification so they know they are supposed to be in a specific place,” said Capaz. “The important part is to maintain the connection to the treatment system.” The role of police coordinating with health officials to ensure treatment demonstrates the altered relationship between them and drug users over the past decade and a half, and one that contrasts dramatically with how police orient themselves in countries like the US. “This small change actually makes a huge change in terms of police officers’ work,” said Capaz, referring to decriminalization. “Of course every police officer knows where people hang out to smoke joints. If they wanted to they would just go there and pick up the same guy over and over. That doesn’t happen.” Working in parallel to government efforts, non-profit groups play a role in providing clean needles and even distributing crack pipes as a way to entice drug users into the network of state service providers. Ricardo Fuertes, project coordinator at GAT, an outreach organization founded by people living with HIV, works at one of the group’s drop-in centers, nestled in a residential building in Lisbon. The location, he says, is a sign of the decrease in stigma towards drug use. “It’s very obvious that it’s a place for people who use drugs. It’s very open, but we don’t have complaints,” said Fuertes, referring to the drop-in center. “The general population even comes to get tests done. I think it shows this isn’t a ghetto service.” But care and outreach providers and the people they help have felt the pinch of Portugal’s economic troubles. In 2011, the country was bailed out by the European Union and the IMF, and later passed austerity measures that imposed considerable cuts on public services. Goulão said that drug treatment programs have been relatively insulated, but funds for job programs that could help employers pay the wages of drug users were decreased. Fuertes went a bit further, saying that some providers have had to lower costs. He explained that government funding may be allocated only for a year at a time, making long-term planning difficult. “It’s not easy for many people, and of course people who use drugs are not the exception,” he said. “We see many of our clients facing very difficult situations.” Portuguese health workers refer to Greece as a cautionary tale. Wracked by a budgetary crisis and the austerity conditions of repeated bailouts, Greece experienced an explosion of HIV transmission rates after budget cuts left health programs drastically underfunded. According to EU figures, only Greece and Latvia experienced larger cuts than Portugal to its public health services between the period of 2005 to 2007 and 2009 to 2012. And yet Portugal experienced no discernable rise in HIV transmission — the cushion effect in action. “Usually the focus is on the decriminalization itself, but it worked because there were other services, and the coverage increased for needle replacement, detox, therapeutic communities, and employment options for people who use drugs,” said Fuertes. “It was the combination of the law and these services that made it a success. It’s very difficult to find people in Portugal who disagree with this model.” In the run-up to the UN General Assembly’s special session, Goulão cautioned that countries had to consider their own domestic environments first in learning from Portugal’s experience. “We don’t assume that this is the silver bullet, but in my view it has been very important because it introduced coherence into the whole system,” he said. “If our responses are based in the idea that we talking about addiction, that we are talking about chronic disease, talking about a health issue — to have it out of the penal system is a clear improvement. It was really important for our society because it allowed us to drop the stigma.” Follow Samuel Oakford on Twitter: @samueloakford",portugals-example-what-happened-after-it-decriminalized-all-drugs-from-weed-to-heroin.txt,drew.uq
"NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw was accused Thursday of pinning former colleague Linda Vester against the wall of her hotel room and forcing her to kiss him, according to an explosive report by Variety. Vester, an anchor and veteran war correspondent, claims Brokaw “physically tried to force her to kiss him on two separate occasions, groped her in an NBC conference room, and showed up at her hotel room uninvited.” The alleged assaults took place in the early 1990s when Brokaw was the “most powerful man at the network” and Vester was a junior reporter who had joined NBC four years earlier. She claims she didn’t speak up at the time because of a culture of silence at NBC, where women who spoke up were labeled “troublemakers” and any such attention could “torpedo your career.”  Brokaw denies the incidents took place, saying he “made no romantic overtures toward her at that time or any other.” NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw was accused Thursday of pinning former colleague Linda Vester against the wall of her hotel room and forcing her to kiss him, according to an explosive report by Variety.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats on Friday took legal action to get hold of all of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s evidence from his inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, as the probe’s findings hit President Donald Trump’s poll ratings.   The number of Americans who approve of Trump dropped by 3 percentage points to the lowest level of the year following the release of a redacted version of Mueller’s report on Thursday, according to a Reuters/Ipsos online opinion poll.  Mueller did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russians but did find “multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations.”  While Mueller ultimately decided not to charge Trump with a crime such as obstruction of justice, he also said that the investigation did not exonerate the president, either.                   U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, issued a subpoena to the Justice Department to hand over the full Mueller report and other relevant evidence by May 1.  “My committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice. The redactions appear to be significant. We have so far seen none of the actual evidence that the Special Counsel developed to make this case,” Nadler said in a statement.  The report provided extensive details on Trump’s efforts to thwart Mueller’s investigation, giving Democrats plenty of political ammunition against the Republican president but no consensus on how to use it.      The document has blacked out sections to hide details about secret grand jury information, U.S. intelligence gathering and active criminal cases as well as potentially damaging information about peripheral players who were not charged.  Six top congressional Democrats led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rejected Attorney General William Barr’s offer to give them access to a less-redacted version of the report. In a letter to Barr, they repeated their demand the full report be given to Congress, but said they were open to “a reasonable accommodation.”  Democratic leaders have played down talk of impeachment of Trump just 18 months before the 2020 presidential election, even as some prominent members of the party’s progressive wing, notably U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, promised to push the idea.  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first major contender for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination to call for the start of impeachment proceedings, saying on Twitter that “the severity of this misconduct” demands it.  “To ignore a President’s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country,” she said.  Trump, who has repeatedly called the Mueller probe a political witch hunt, lashed out again on Friday.  “Statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report...which are fabricated & totally untrue,” Trump wrote on Twitter.  He seemed to be referring to former White House counsel Don McGahn who was cited in the report as having annoyed Trump by taking notes of his conversations with the president.      “Watch out for people that take so-called “notes,” when the notes never existed until needed.” Trump wrote, “it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the “Report” about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad).”  Phone conversations between the president and McGahn in June 2017 were a central part of Mueller’s depiction of Trump as trying to derail the Russia inquiry. The report said Trump told McGahn to instruct the Justice Department to fire Mueller. McGahn did not carry out the order.        In analyzing whether Trump obstructed justice, Mueller revealed details about how the president tried to fire him and limit his investigation, kept details of a June 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and a Russian under wraps, and possibly dangled a pardon to a former adviser.                   According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll of 1,005 adults conducted Thursday afternoon to Friday morning, 37 percent of people approve of Trump’s performance in office - down from 40 percent in a similar poll conducted on April 15 and matches the lowest level of the year. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.   Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said the Democrats’ subpoena “is wildly overbroad” and would jeopardize a grand jury’s investigations.  The Mueller inquiry laid bare what U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a Russian campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States, denigrate 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump.   Russia said on Friday that Mueller’s report did not contain any evidence that Moscow had meddled. “We, as before, do not accept such allegations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.     Asked on Friday about Russian interference in 2016, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Washington that “we will make very clear to them that this is not acceptable behavior.”  Trump has tried to cultivate good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and came under heavy criticism in Washington last year for saying after meeting Putin that he accepted his denial of election meddling, over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies.  Half a dozen former Trump aides, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, were charged by Mueller’s office or convicted of crimes during his 22-month-long investigation. The Mueller inquiry spawned a number of other criminal probes by federal prosecutors in New York and elsewhere.   One reason it would be difficult to charge Trump is that the Justice Department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president should not be indicted, although the U.S. Constitution is silent on whether a president can face criminal prosecution in court.  A paragraph in the report is at the heart of whether Mueller, a former FBI director, intended Congress to pursue further action against Trump.  “The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law,” Mueller wrote.    Republican Collins said Democrats had misconstrued that section of the report to suit their anti-Trump agenda.          “There seems to be some confusion...This isn’t a matter of legal interpretation; it’s reading comprehension,” Collins wrote on Twitter.   “The report doesn’t say Congress should investigate obstruction now. It says Congress can make laws about obstruction under Article I powers,” Collins said.  Nadler told reporters on Thursday that Mueller probably wrote the report with the intent of providing Congress a road map for future action against the president, but the Democratic congressman said it was too early to talk about impeachment.  But the House Oversight Committee’s Democratic chairman, Elijah Cummings, said impeachment was not ruled out.  “A lot of people keep asking about the question of impeachment ... We may very well come to that very soon, but right now let’s make sure we understand what Mueller was doing, understand what Barr was doing, and see the report in an unredacted form and all of the underlying documents,” he told MSNBC.  Short of attempting impeachment, Democratic lawmakers can use the details of Mueller’s report to fuel other inquiries already underway by congressional committees.  Only two U.S. presidents have been impeached: Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868 after firing his secretary of war in the tumultuous aftermath of the American Civil War. Both were acquitted by the Senate and stayed in office.   In 1974, a House committee approved articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon over the Watergate scandal but he resigned before the full House voted on impeachment.

Having worked in the media, I knew it could help people come to terms with their sexuality by letting them know they are not alone. Though we couldn't produce our own videos, we were able to take videos produced elsewhere and translate them. I collaborated with producers from around the world, subtitled their videos in Urdu, and released them on our platform. Soon we had producers contacting us and waving copyrights, allowing us to reproduce videos as we saw fit for a local audience. Watch VICE News' Blackout: Pakistan, about the plight of that country's LGBTQ community. But in the meantime, the backlash continued — and it worsened as we started to post more often. Our slogan was ""Don't hate us, know us."" This clearly was not taken to heart by everyone. In comments and private messages, people started calling for ""death for whoever is behind the project."" A friend of mine even told me I had gone too far, saying that while he could accept my ""lewd"" lifestyle, he objected to the way I was ""corrupting"" people. I got a phone call from someone who said, ""We're watching you,"" and that I should quit my ""online activities."" His number was blocked, and when I called the cellular company to request the number, I was told that I would need to go to the police first. But for me, that, of course, was impossible. By September of 2013, I was admittedly panicked. Some concerned activist friends were suggesting I shut down the project and run it from outside Pakistan; I ultimately decided to do neither. That month, however, the site became inaccessible, and a message from the federal government's Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) stated that QueerPK was ""not safe"" to be viewed in the country. I contacted international media outlets to inform them of the ban, and stories ran in several places, including the BBC and CNN. AFP interviewed the spokesperson of the PTA, who said the website was ""against Islam."" I transferred the site to a new domain, and announced it on social media platforms and mailing lists. However, the government soon banned this site as well. Since the project was self-financed and had only volunteers on whom to rely, I couldn't keep up with the game of online hide-and-seek. By early 2014, the project was dead. I have been attempting a third re-launch, but I am not optimistic about the future. I would still be battling the government if this was a fair fight, but when you're accused of doing something ""anti-Islam"" and ""anti-Pakistan,"" the government essentially has license to deal with you as it deems fit.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased moderately in May and prices rose slightly, pointing to slowing economic growth and benign inflation pressures, which could give the Federal Reserve more ammunition to cut interest rates next month.  The Commerce Department said on Friday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and spent more at restaurants and on hotel accommodation.  Data for April was revised up to show consumer spending advancing 0.6% instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent gain. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would rise 0.4% last month.  Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% last month as a rebound in food prices was tempered by moderate gains in the cost of other goods. The PCE price index increased 0.3% in April.   In the 12 months through May, the PCE price index increased 1.5%, slowing from April’s 1.6% increase.  Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index climbed 0.2% last month after a similar gain in April. In the 12 months through May, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.6%, matching April’s rise.  The core PCE index is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure and has undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target this year. The Fed last week signaled rate cuts as early as July, citing low inflation, as well as growing risks to the economy from an escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China.   The central bank downgraded its inflation projection for 2019 to 1.5% from 1.8% in March. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dropped his description of weak inflation as “transient.”   When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2% in May. This so-called real consumer spending increased by the same margin in April. The increase in real spending in the last two months suggested consumer spending was struggling to accelerate after slowing in the first quarter.  Consumers spending increased at a 0.9% annualized rate in the first quarter, the slowest in a year. The overall economy grew at a 3.1% rate last quarter, boosted by exports, an accumulation of inventory and government spending on highways and defense.   Last month, spending on goods increased 0.5%, with outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods such as motor vehicles surging 1.7%. Spending on services gained 0.4%.  Consumer spending in May was supported by a 0.5% rise in  personal income, which matched April’s increase. Wages gained 0.2%. Savings rose to $985.4 billion from $975.0 billion in April.

"On Sunday, “white civil rights activist” Jason Kessler will lead an undetermined number of alt-right, far-right, and white supremacist individuals and organizations in the “Unite the Right 2” gathering in Washington, DC, on the first anniversary of the group’s disastrous rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that claimed the life of a young woman. As I wrote earlier this week, the ultimate size of the event is anyone’s guess: It’s not clear how many people will attend Unite the Right 2 — many white nationalists have already said they have no interest in going, while others who might otherwise attend are enmeshed in legal troubles stemming from last year’s rally. Meanwhile, organizers of the coalition DC Against Hate have told at least one outlet that they expect at least 1,000 counterprotesters to attend events aimed against Unite the Right 2 under the banner “Shut It Down DC.” But no matter the number of rallygoers present, Unite the Right 2 — taking place on the first anniversary of much of America’s first experience of the alt-right’s racism and anti-Semitism — will have a lot to tell us. When Kessler applied for a permit to rally in Lafayette Square, directly across from the White House, he stated that he expected roughly 400 people to attend — a number he has since admitted in court he just “pulled out of a hat.” In short, it is extremely unlikely that attendance numbers will rival those of last year’s Unite the Right, which included a tiki torch-lit parade of white supremacists marching through the campus of the University of Virginia alongside the disastrous rally the following day that ended in the murder of counter-activist Heather Heyer. In a movement that is largely disintegrating, many of the biggest names in the alt-right and white supremacist far right are staying far away from this year’s rally. That’s both because of the aftermath of last year’s event and because of a debate roiling the alt-right about whether or not “optics” — like chanting, “Jews will not replace us,” before marching under a Nazi flag — matter, and whether they should even be rallying in public in the first place. But at least on one point, many within the alt-right agree: Jason Kessler is not to be trusted. As one neo-Nazi figure posted on the social media platform website Gab — which is popular with alt-right figures banned from Twitter — earlier this summer, “Follow Kessler and you get what you deserve.” Some within the alt-right even think that Kessler is a “subversive” who is leading the movement into risky situations like Unite the Right on purpose. Another Gab user arguing, “Avoiding this rally IS being tactical and strategic because there is only an opportunity for the media to use this to demonize Trump and his supporters as fascists.” For his part, Kessler is attempting to publicly distance himself from the white supremacist alt-right (while still filing court documents listing self-avowed anti-Semitic Holocaust deniers as potential speakers at Unite the Right 2.) And not only are many within the alt-right and white nationalist movement not attending this year — because of last year’s rally, “optics,” or Jason Kessler — but those who are attending are facing the ramifications of Kessler’s poor planning: ... coordinating this event has seemingly been chaotic at best, as revealed by recent internal Facebook chats from Unite the Right planners (obtained from an anonymous source by the media collective Unicorn Riot, a left-leaning investigative journalism nonprofit). The chats appear to show Kessler arguing with other planners about a wide range of issues. Those include basic logistics like transportation and housing; whether or not a nonwhite speaker would give them “political cover” to have major white supremacist figures speak as well; and whether there’s a good way to “normalize” anti-Semitism without appearing to do so (in other words, without using anti-Semitic memes). Attendance numbers, then, won’t tell us everything about how strong (or how fragmented) the alt-right has been since Charlottesville, but they will give us a snapshot of a part of the current movement. In the wake of the violence of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville — which an independent investigation showed the response of Charlottesville Police contributed to — DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, DC Chief of Police Peter Newsham, and regional police announced on Thursday that the city had already deployed its emergency operations center in advance of the rally. Other city officials told the media that regional police — including departments in Maryland and Virginia — were prepared for the rally. After a man fired a shot at a counterprotester in Charlottesville, no guns will be permitted at Unite the Right events or counterdemonstrations in Washington, with or without a permit. And as the groups participating in Unite the Right 2 plan to travel to and from the rally using Washington’s metro system, the Metro Transit Police are coordinating with local police and officials. Sharon Bulova from the Fairfax County Board of Governors tweeted that rallygoers will be meeting at the Vienna Metro Station to ride into Washington, and that law enforcement would have “an increased presence at the station.” The town of Vienna is located within Fairfax County. pic.twitter.com/Vbm9ZBHIes One advantage Washington enjoys in advance of the rally is significant experience with large-scale marches and events, from presidential inaugurations to the 2017 Women’s March on Washington. In addition, the site of the rally, Lafayette Square, is also federal land, under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, which is joining forces with DC Police and the US Secret Service (as the park is so close to the White House) to prevent any violence. National Park Service spokesperson Mike Litterst told ABC7 in Washington, “The park police and the law enforcement partners are looking at any lessons that may be learned from previous demonstrations to ensure there is no violence.” The decision by many who attended the tiki torch-lit rally that launched Unite the Right last summer to dress in polo shirts and khaki pants was a purposeful one. As neo-Nazi organizer Andrew Anglin wrote on his Daily Stormer website in advance of the rally in 2017, rallygoers should avoid shorts, wear button-downs, and above all: It is very important to look good. ... I cannot stress the point hard enough – I’m hitting italics again – we need to be extremely conscious of what we look like, and how we present ourselves. That matters more than our ideas. If that is sad to you, I’m sorry, but that is just human nature. If people see a bunch of mismatched overweight slobs, they are not going to care what they are saying. But since the chaos of Charlottesville, the alt-right has been divided among those who want to attempt to look mainstream while advocating for white nationalism and anti-Semitism, and those who view such concerns over appearance as “optics-cucking.” As I wrote on Friday: Even before this year’s rally was announced, the alt-right had already been embroiled in a debate about whether caring about looking less like hardened fascists and neo-Nazis and more like everyday white American citizens is a goal or, as the Daily Beast first reported, an example of weakness or even “optics-cucking” — “cuck” being a reference to a pornography genre in which a man watches another man have sex with his wife. Kessler has taken the mainstream position, expressly forbidding any flags besides the American flag and the Confederate flag from being flown at the rally. But others who may be in attendance could be from the latter camp, and far more willing to wear alt-right and far-right regalia and display fascist and neo-Nazi symbols. How national media outlets depict the groups and individuals attending Unite the Right, the counterprotesters, and the rally itself will be critical to understanding the wider cultural impact that the alt-right movement is having. Part of the goal of the white supremacist alt-right is to push their opinions into the mainstream via mainstream media outlets. And many of those outlets, in their efforts to explain alt-right and white supremacist views, have been accused by some of “normalizing” them. Already, NPR has been heavily criticized for a seven-minute Morning Edition interview with Kessler where, with little pushback, Kessler defended his racist views and even listed racial groups by IQ. Media outlets should think long & hard before granting white supremacists a platform that can reach millions. This piece was not a general story quoting Kessler for a few seconds, among others--it was a one-on-one interview. No experts, no debunking or exposure of mistruths. https://t.co/14UdrDAvdJ The most important reactions to Unite the Right won’t be from rallygoers, or even from the media — they’ll be from politicians, including President Donald Trump, whose muted reaction to Charlottesville (saying there were “very fine people on both sides” at Unite the Right, for example) was widely criticized. On Saturday in advance of this year’s rally, Trump tweeted, “I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans.” The riots in Charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division. We must come together as a nation. I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans! But it’s not just Trump. Several Republican 2018 candidates have explicit ties to Unite the Right and the alt-right more generally, most notably GOP congressional candidate Corey Stewart, who has not only appeared at events with Kessler (and received his endorsement in the Virginia GOP primary) but employs a staffer who was taking part in planning for Unite the Right 2. And that’s not to mention that at least one failed GOP candidate, self-described Holocaust denier and anti-Semite Patrick Little, is already in attendance at Unite the Right 2-associated events, and another alt-right congressional candidate, Wisconsin’s Paul Nehlen, was on Kessler’s wish list of potential speakers. The Unite the Right 2-related activities have already kicked off in DC. Videos posted on Gab show neo-Nazi Patrick Little and former Phillies' ""Pistachio Girl"" Emily Youcis, who reinvented herself as a white nationalist, getting in arguments with people by the White House. In contrast, former Republican president candidate and current Senate candidate Mitt Romney shared a blog post on his campaign website on Saturday titled, “As I See It: Race and Equality,” in which he denounced Unite the Right 2 rallygoers and the alt-right (alongside Trump’s “both sides” rhetoric), adding: There are some besotted and misguided souls who long for a population that is more homogeneous — more white. They even disparage legal immigration, ignoring the fact that nearly all Americans are immigrants or descendants of immigrants. But can they not at least recognize — whether or not they like it — we are, in fact, a highly diverse population? And given this reality, “united we stand and divided we fall.” The equality of the intrinsic worth of every person is a truth fundamental to our national founding and moral order. Here are my thoughts on the one-year anniversary of Charlottesville: https://t.co/9wC4is38q2",what-sundays-unite-the-right-2-tells-us-about-the-state-of-the-altright-.txt,drew.uq
"Last Wednesday, the No. 1 trending video on YouTube was based on a lie. The video alleged that David Hogg, a 17-year-old survivor of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, was an “actor.” After the shooting, Hogg had become a compelling and sympathetic proponent of gun control, making the rounds on cable news. This YouTube video contained a clip of Hogg speaking on camera for a Los Angeles local news segment last summer. The video was captioned “DAVID HOGG THE ACTOR....” — the implication being that Hogg suspiciously shows up whenever news cameras are rolling. YouTube took down the video and others like it — including one Infowars video headlined “David Hogg Can’t Remember His Lines in TV Interview.” But the video-sharing platform was hardly the only place similar conspiracy theories flourished, as Vox’s Matt Yglesias outlined. Right-wing celebrities suggest that George Soros was funding the anti-gun outcry. Elsewhere, outlets were pointing out that Hogg is the son of a retired FBI agent (the implication being that the FBI is out to get President Donald Trump). We’ve seen this before. After a tragedy, conspiracy theories emerge, and they are powerful, mean, and damaging. Consider the unending hurt of the parents of children slain during the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. For years, they have been charged with making up the whole tragedy (including the lives of their children). Or the agony of the family of Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staffer who was murdered in an apparent robbery attempt in 2016. Despite zero evidence, conspiracy theorists and conservative pundits fanned suspicions that Rich was murdered by the Clinton campaign. “Seth’s death has been turned into a political football,” Rich’s parents wrote at the Washington Post. Conspiracy theories are an infuriating plague on our media ecosystem. But they’re not inexplicable. We can understand why they spread so far and wide. Here are the two key reasons. When it comes to political debates, we don’t use our smarts to uncover the truth. We use our smarts to protect the groups and worldview to which we adhere. This is called politically motivated reasoning, and it distorts how we see the world. Asheley Landrum, a Texas Tech University psychologist who has studied conspiracy theorizing, suggests this might be what’s happening among those theorizing about the Parkland students. “To counteract the kids’ powerful speech, a conspiracy narrative arises that allows individuals to dismiss or ignore [the kids’ perspectives],” she writes in an email. Why would people want to counteract the kids? Well, because of where their pleas for greater gun control might lead: to greater gun control. And in the minds of right-wing conspiracy theorists, it’s easier to dismiss the kids outright than to actually engage with their arguments. Psychologists have found that people aren’t necessarily afraid of facts — they’re afraid of where those facts lead. This is called “solution aversion,” and it helps explain why many conservatives are wary of the science of climate change — because many solutions to climate change involve increasing government oversight and regulations. Similarly, right-wingers may be discrediting the kids because they don’t want to see changes to gun laws. One crucial thing to know about motivated reasoning is that you often don’t realize you’re doing it. We automatically have an easier time remembering information that fits our worldviews. We’re simply quicker to recognize information that confirms what we already know, which makes us blind to facts that discount it. Psychological research also finds that some people are just more prone to believing in conspiracy theories than others. And it’s not because these people are necessarily unintelligent (though being a more analytic person is correlated with being less swayed by conspiracies.) Instead, believing in conspiracy theories, psychological research informs us, is a coping mechanism to deal with uncertainty in the world. “It’s a self-protective mechanism people have,” Jan-Willem van Prooijen, a psychologist who studies conspiracy theories, told me last year. The theories are a tool by which people can feel more in control and find explanations in a scary and turbulent world. The thought of 17 kids being gunned down at school is horrible. Why wouldn’t we seek refuge in a theory that insists it wasn’t so bad after all? Van Prooijen expanded on what makes people more susceptible than others to believing in the theories: One of them is education level. Conspiracy theories are more likely among people who are [less] educated. But this doesn’t mean that people who are highly educated are immune. There’s also effects of political ideology. In our research, we find the more radical a person’s politics [both left- and right-wing], the more likely they are to be conspiracy theorists. Another is collective narcissism [a personality trait where people demand the group they belong to be admired], and people who believe their own nation and group is superior to others. People who feel powerless and who are more pessimistic are also more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, van Prooijen finds. And this is where education and outreach can help. Achieving higher levels of education correlates to feeling more secure about the world, and this, in turn, seems to protect against a conspiratorial mindset. Conspiracy theories aren’t new. But today they, fueled by computer algorithms that award grabbiness and not truth and deliberate misinformation campaigns, spread like wildfire. And the big tech giants are often hesitant or sluggish in taking them down. (After the shooting in Las Vegas in October, Google featured a link to an anonymous message board notorious for fueling conspiracy theories in its “top stories” module.) Plus, there are whole media outlets — like Infowars — that have built huge followings peddling junk theories. The theories are also dangerous because of a psychological phenomenon called the illusory truth effect. Its impact is subtle, but basically, it means that simply repeating a lie makes it more likely to be misidentified as truth. Each time a reader encounters a conspiracy theory on Facebook, Google, or really anywhere, it makes a subtle impression. Each time, the story grows more familiar, and that familiarity casts the illusion of truth. The more we hear a piece of information repeated, the more we’re likely to believe it. This is true for “even things that people have reason not to believe,” Gord Pennycook, a psychologist who studies misinformation at Yale University, told me last year. So consider this: When YouTube took down the conspiracy video last Wednesday, it had already been viewed 200,000 times.",conspiracy-theories-flourished-after-the-parkland-shooting-heres-why.txt,drew.uq
"Republicans in Congress are keeping their tax plan moving right on schedule, with a quick-strike strategy and an uncanny knack for waving away the trade-offs that come with overhauling the nation’s tax code. House Republicans passed their tax bill exactly two weeks after detailed legislative text was released. Senate Republicans are now preparing to take up their own plan later this week, so long as they keep defections to a minimum. GOP leaders are cutting deals to keep 50 of their 52 members onboard and approve the tax legislation. The Washington Post reported on Monday that Republicans were weighing amendments to the tax treatment of “pass-through” businesses to win over the lone defector so far, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and to the bill’s overhaul of state and local tax deductions to keep other waving senators from opposing the bill. Plenty of pitfalls lie ahead. But the tax plan has yet to encounter any hurdle it can’t clear or any concerns Republicans can’t dismiss. The GOP’s top priority, after the failure of Obamacare repeal, is charging ahead on momentum alone. This is all in spite of the plan itself. Most Americans disapprove of the House and Senate proposals, according to new polling from Quinnipiac. Outside analyses have estimated that more than 25 percent of taxpayers would pay more by 2027 under the House bill. The Senate bill is projected to raise taxes on Americans making less than $30,000 a year starting in 2021. The Senate bill also includes a repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate, which the CBO estimates will lead to 13 million fewer Americans with health insurance. In the House, Republicans from New York, New Jersey, and California could have banded together to block the bill because the elimination of state and local tax deductions acutely hurts their constituents. But they didn’t. The House bill never appeared to be in danger of failing. In the Senate, up next after the House passes their version, only Johnson has defected so far. Senate leaders are talking confidently about their ability to wrangle together a majority, even with their thin margin for error. Overriding any specific concern is the GOP’s desperate desire to secure a major legislative victory and a truncated public debate that has prevented any sustained resistance from taking hold. Sweeping tax changes, at least for now, appear to be happening. Republican leaders and the rank and file have portrayed passing a tax overhaul as an existential issue after the failure to repeal Obamacare, the party’s other longstanding campaign promise. “The way I see it, honestly, is we’ve got to get our job done,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said after this month’s Virginia elections, which many observers saw as an omen of a Democratic wave in 2018. “I think what people want to know and see is that this Donald Trump presidency and this Republican Congress makes a positive difference.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) put it more plainly late last month as the tax debate debate was picking up. ""Well, I think all of us realize that if we fail on taxes, that's the end of the Republican Party's governing majority in 2018,"" he said. Congressional Republicans have been shockingly candid about their motivations, telling reporters that donors have said directly if the party fails on a tax overhaul, campaign contributions will dry up. ""My donors are basically saying, 'Get it done or don’t ever call me again,’” Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) said recently. To prevent a tax overhaul from suffering Obamacare repeal’s fate, Republicans have sought to move quickly and perfected their ability to disregard evidence from outside experts that their tax bill won’t achieve what they promised. The House bill was introduced on November 2, a markup in the House Ways and Means Committee started four days later, and within two weeks, Republicans were putting the plan on the House floor for a vote. The Senate bill moved equally fast. It was introduced on November 9, passed by the Senate Finance committee a week later and could be passed by the entire Senate less than three weeks after its introduction. Amid that mad dash, lawmakers are making big promises about the tax legislation, suggesting it could add tens of millions of jobs to the US economy. “If we can get 20 million people back to work, it’s going to be big,” Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL) told Vox. The independent analyses have been less rosy. A Penn analysis projected that the House bill would add up to 0.83 percentage points to the economy’s growth in 2027. A Tax Policy Center estimate found that the individual tax cuts in the House plan would overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent a decade from now. And meanwhile, millions of US households would eventually see higher taxes, as the New York Times detailed. But that hasn’t deterred Republicans. They have simply insisted that every American would benefit, despite experts’ findings. “It lets every American keep more of what they earned,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said, a claim that PolitiFact rated false. By the same token, after months of promising revenue-neutral tax reform, both the House and Senate bills are projected to increase the federal deficit by more than $1 trillion. There, again, Republicans are simply dismissing the official findings, claiming that the economic growth spurred by the overhaul would erase any projected deficit growth. “I think this tax bill is going to reduce the size of our deficits going forward,” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), one of the primary architects of the plan, told reporters last week. There has been nothing, so far, that can’t be explained away. Speed has helped Republicans keep their tax plans moving. The House bill went from introduction to passage in two weeks. The Senate bill is on a similarly accelerated timeline. This is not the months-long debate that helped derail the Obamacare repeal crusade. But ironically, health care could end up being the biggest hurdle lying ahead for Republicans, particularly in the Senate, where 50 of the 52 Republican senators must back the tax plan. They’ve already lost one for the time being, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), who isn’t satisfied with the changes for small firms that are taxed as individuals, known as “pass-throughs.” Two more defectors would sink the current bill. Now the Senate has added the repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate to its tax legislation, a provision that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would lead to 13 million fewer Americans having health insurance by 2027 and a 10 percent increase in premiums. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who both voted down a health care plan this summer that did little more than repeal the mandate, expressed their reservations about mixing health care with taxes after the change was announced. “Tax reform is complicated enough, and when you add health care reform in at the same time, it continues to complicate it,” Murkowski told reporters. But neither of them has committed to voting against the tax plan over the issue either. Murkowski in particular has a big reason to vote for the tax bill: It would also open up the Arctic Wildlife Refuge for more oil and gas drilling, a longstanding goal of Alaska politicians. Collins is also the target of last-minute changes to state and local tax deductions, according to the Post. Other possible defectors — like Sens. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who are worried about the federal deficit — are still on the fence too. Corker aides sounded optimistic on Monday that their boss will ultimately be able to support the final bill. Corker staff says he has worked over break with admin and senators to get tax bill changed. ""While more work remains, all parties are hopeful that the final bill will be good for our country.” One final wild card will be Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who has at times been fixated on bipartisanship and regular order. He already showed in the health care debate that he is willing to buck the party if he isn’t satisfied with the product or process. But with Obamacare repeal, it was easy to identify as many as a dozen “no” votes at times. The tax bill also has to thread a narrow needle, but Senate Republican leaders have thus far prevented a critical mass of their conference from jumping ship. Even Johnson, who also blanched at the health care bills periodically, could still be won over. If both chambers do pass a tax bill, they will still have to reconcile their differences. Touchy issues like the state and local tax deduction and Obamacare repeal could complicate those conference negotiations. But over the course of two weeks, congressional Republicans have set themselves to get this win. Their dreams of passing a major tax bill by the end of the year suddenly don’t seem so farfetched.",republicans-are-racing-to-pass-their-huge-tax-overhaul.txt,drew.uq
"If President Donald Trump doesn’t like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), he really won’t like her if Democrats take back the House in the 2018 midterm elections. The California Democrat is poised to take over the House Financial Services Committee if Democrats are in the majority, and such a position, she could wield a lot of power. There are already some hints about how Waters could use that perch to probe the scandals and conflicts of interest swirling around the Trump administration. Waters is currently the ranking member of the committee, which is charged with overseeing the financial services industry, including banks, insurers, and housing. As ranking member, she’s pushed for probes into the financial ties of Trump and those around him, including his relationship with Deutsche Bank and, perhaps, Russia. Her hands have been tied on taking action because she’s not chair, but if Democrats take the House and she is, that changes. She’ll have the ability to issue subpoenas, call hearings, and request depositions, including regarding the money trails surrounding Trump. “Maxine Waters is one of the leading voices of the Democratic Party, and the tone, tenor, and tenacity of the House Financial Services Committee chairmanship is going to change next year materially [if Democrats win],” Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at research firm Compass Point, told me. “It’s been a little bit of a sleepy committee for the last few years, but that’s going to change if Rep. Waters gets the gavel.” Waters is 14-term House member who represents California’s 43rd Congressional District, which covers part of Los Angeles. Since Trump was elected, she has positioned herself as a fierce Trump critic: She refused to attend his inauguration and boycotted his State of the Union address, and she’s repeatedly called for his removal from office. At Glamour magazine’s Women of the Year awards in November, she led attendees in a chant of “Impeach 45!” Recently, she’s been in the headlines for urging her supporters to “push back” against Trump administration officials in public, telling them to confront Cabinet members and others to let them know “they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.” Waters said she received death threats after her remarks, and last week, she canceled a pair of appearances in Alabama and Texas out of caution. But she’s remained defiant. At a Families Belong Together rally over the weekend, she criticized the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance immigration policies that resulted in family separation. She also called for Trump’s impeachment and challenged those making threats against her. “If you shoot me, you better shoot straight,” she said at a Families Belong Together rally in Los Angeles. “There’s nothing like a wounded animal.” Waters faced backlash over her comments about protesting Trump officials, including criticism from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI). Trump falsely claimed on Twitter she called for harming his supporters. (She did not.) Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! Despite the criticism, Democrats are sticking by Waters as their top candidate to run the Financial Services Committee should they take back the House in November. And there, she would have a lot of power. As ranking member, Waters has pushed for more information on Trump and Deutsche Bank. The German bank is one of the few banks that still lends money to Trump after his multiple bankruptcies and financial woes. It’s also done deals with the president’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. It made a $285 million loan to him just a month before the 2016 election. Waters has also pressed for details on Trump’s deals with Russia. In May 2017, Waters sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking him for information on Trump’s financial ties with Russia. She has written multiple letters to Deutsche Bank asking about its Trump ties and in August 2017 asked House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) to subpoena them. She and other committee Democrats also introduced a resolution of inquiry to “follow the Trump money trail” last year. Because the minority party doesn’t have subpoena power, Maxine hasn’t been able to do much beyond writing letters. But if Democrats are in the majority, that changes. Boltansky, the analyst, said he would expect multiple subpoenas, hearings, and other efforts to get information about and draw attention to Trump’s financial dealings with Waters in charge. “She’s interested in Deutsche Bank’s relationship to Trump, in Citigroup’s relationship to the Kushner family, and how all of the different activities of the Trump administration have a bearing on public policy,” he said. Her number one power is the hearing, he added, because “hearings with big names bring cameras, and that elevates an issue immediately.” It is worth noting that special counsel Robert Mueller also reportedly subpoenaed Deutsche Banks for what it has on Trump or his associates. The White House is also probing Kushner’s loans from Citibank. “Financial services issues are critical for all Americans and for our economy, and I am focused on making sure that our financial system is fair,” Waters said in an emailed statement. “I am committed to ensuring that hardworking Americans and our nation’s small businesses have opportunities to thrive, expanding and supporting affordable housing opportunities for our nation’s families, making sure that the safeguards are in place to prevent another financial crisis, protecting consumers and investors from bad actors, and conducting appropriate oversight of the administration and the regulatory agencies under the committee’s jurisdiction.” Unless Democrats take back the Senate as well, which isn’t expected to happen, most of the legislation Democrats pass in the House, including from Rep. Waters out of the House Financial Services Committee, is unlikely to become law. But she can still propose bills and sponsor legislation. Beyond an aggressive oversight agenda, Waters is likely to focus on key messaging issues with legislative proposals — items such as economic inequality and financial industry regulation. This Congress, she has introduced 15 financial services bills so far, including one that would shut down banks that repeatedly harm consumers, another to improve public housing, and another to overhaul credit reporting. By next year, the whole financial regulatory regime will be led by Trump appointees. Waters won’t be able to put a stop to Trump’s deregulatory push, but she could slow it with hearings, letters, and public attention, Boltansky said. Waters is also expected to focus on embattled megabank Wells Fargo. Last year, she issued a 38-report on the bank and called for it to be shut down entirely. “When a megabank has engaged in a pattern of extensive violations of law that harms millions of consumers, like Wells Fargo has, it should not be allowed to continue to operate within our nation’s banking system, and avail itself of all of the associated privileges afforded to it,” the report read. She also secured a hearing on the Equifax data breach last year, and there could certainly be more of that. Waters is not without baggage of her own, including on the financial front. She previously faced scrutiny over her role in pushing for a bailout for a bank tied to her family, the Daily Beast points out. An ethics investigation cleared her, but it did find wrongdoing by her then-chief of staff and grandson, and there have been other questions raised about whether members of her family have profited from her position. In 2011, watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) named Waters one of the most corrupt politicians. Waters, 79, has for years been an outspoken member of the House, but in the era of Trump, her voice has grown much louder, or at least it’s gotten a lot more attention. A video of her declaring, “Reclaiming my time,” at a 2017 Congressional hearing went viral on the internet, and President Trump has made a habit out of targeting her in his attacks. The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who, together with Nancy Pelosi, have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats, who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime, well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres. Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party. Her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the Democrats! If Democrats take back the House in November, and Waters takes over the House Financial Services Committee, as expected, you can expect a lot more Maxine Waters headlines, Trump tweets, and memes. Update: Story has been updated to clarify that Waters will likely be able to pass legislation out of the House Financial Services Committee if Democrats take back the House. If Republicans hold the Senate, it will be unlikely to become law.",maxine-waters-could-be-a-problem-for-trump-if-democrats-win-the-house.txt,drew.uq
"The Senate went on summer break this week, after a lame attempt to give working parents some relief. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced the Economic Security Act for New Parents last week, with support from White House adviser Ivanka Trump. The full text of the bill hasn’t been released, but it’s been sold as providing parents with “paid parental leave” after the birth or adoption of a child. The bill is not, in fact, paid leave. It’s another version of unpaid leave that working parents in the United States would have to pay for themselves. A summary of the bill shows that it would merely let workers access some of their Social Security retirement income in advance to make up for some of the wages they would lose when taking parental leave. Workers would still bear the cost of taking time off — by delaying their own retirement. The United States is the only industrialized country that doesn’t guarantee paid parental leave to working parents, and Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly support the creation of such a program. The problem is that no one seems to agree on how to pay for it, and Rubio’s bill is the weakest proposal yet because Social Security, as it stands, is in trouble. The idea of a government-run program to provide maternity and paternity leave to new parents is not controversial. About 74 percent of registered US voters in 2016 said they wanted the government to do so. When you break down the numbers, the support is overwhelming across genders, political parties, and even income groups. In other words, it’s a safe political issue for Republicans to tackle, if only they weren’t so afraid to make businesses pay part of the cost. Nearly every industrialized country in the world provides working mothers with at least three months of paid maternity leave — the minimum recommended by the United Nations’ International Labour Organization. In most of those countries, employers and employees pay a tax to fund the benefit. Canada has this type of system, which allows parents to take a year of leave while receiving 55 percent of their salary (up to 80 percent of wages are covered for low-income workers). Some US businesses voluntarily offer paid parental leave to their workers, but only about one in 10 workers in the country get such a benefit from their employer. Low-wage workers are the least likely to get it. In response to federal inaction on the issue, several states have started requiring employers to provide some paid leave: California, New York, and the District of Columbia are among those that do. Research shows that paid leave programs improve child health, promote gender equality, and help keep women in the workforce. Studies have shown that California’s paid-leave law, which went into effect in 2004, led to an increase in work hours and income for mothers with young children. Studies have also shown that paid leave is linked to lower poverty rates in 18 countries. The need for paid leave in the United States is more urgent than ever, as nearly half of two-parent US households with children have parents who both work full-time jobs. Economists believe the lack of paid leave is one reason American women are dropping out of the labor force, and that’s bad news for the US economy. About 75 percent of working-age women are part of the US workforce, reflecting a slow decline since 2000, when 77 percent held jobs. Economists have various theories for the decline, including the shrinking job market for low-skilled workers and the growing cost of child care. When women joined the public labor force en masse in the 1970s, their earnings were a huge boost to the US economy, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama. They attributed nearly all of the middle-class income growth since 1970 to the rise of women entering the US workforce. But female participation in the job market began to flatten out in the 1990s and is now declining, even though it continues to increase in other developed countries. Nearly a third of the decline of American women in the labor force, in comparison to other developed countries, can be explained by the lack of family-friendly workplace policies in the United States, including paid leave for new parents, according to research by economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn at Cornell University. Coming up with an effective paid parental leave system in the United States isn’t hard. The hard part is getting Republicans to agree that businesses should pay for some of it. Which is how we got to Rubio’s shortsighted plan. There are few details about Rubio’s paid leave plan. But here is what we know about it: New parents would dip into their Social Security retirement benefits to cover part of the cost of taking time off from work. Through the plan, up to 70 percent of their wages would be covered for two months of leave. However, that would mean delaying their retirement payments through Social Security at least three to six months per child. The benefit is not available for other types of paid leave, such as workers who need to take time off to care for a sick relative. So Rubio’s “paid leave” program is essentially unpaid, at least by employers, since workers are the ones paying for their own time off. Employers pay nothing, and neither does the federal government. Even worse, the plan doesn’t take into account the fact that the future of Social Security is in jeopardy. The system is running a deficit for the first time in more than 30 years, and the Social Security Administration expects that it will run out of money to pay workers their full retirement benefits by 2035. Allowing workers to take more money from the system will only make the problem worse. There are better options out there. A group of influential conservative and liberal economists proposed one not-so-ideal option last year: pay for parental leave by increasing payroll taxes on workers, and through other savings in the federal budget. The downside is that the plan still lets businesses off the hook from shouldering any of the cost. Sharing the cost between employees and businesses seem obvious. That’s how most workers’ insurance programs operate, and that’s how most paid parental leave programs across the world work. Businesses should share the burden of paying for the program because they benefit from paid leave too. Female employees are more likely to return to their jobs after giving birth, keeping more workers in the labor force for employers to hire when the economy is growing (like it is now). An even broader option is some version of the FAMILY Act, which Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced in 2017. The bill offers workers up to 12 weeks off with up to 66 percent of their wages covered for family and medical leave. The benefit would be paid for with a tax levied on workers and employers (about 2 cents each for every $10 paid in wages). And the plan is flexible so that it benefits all employees, not just parents. That’s because it would be available to any worker who needs to take time off to care for a relative, or for a medical procedure. The bill has more than 30 Democratic co-sponsors, but no Republican lawmakers will touch it.",americans-want-paid-maternity-leave-the-rubioivanka-plan-will-hurt-social-security.txt,drew.uq

"Younger members of the House Democratic caucus wanted to delay leadership elections to see if a strong challenger to Nancy Pelosi would emerge, and lo and behold, one has — Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Ryan is a 43-year-old white man from Youngstown who represents a somewhat squiggly-looking congressional district that includes large numbers of African Americans and working-class white voters. His political profile leans toward populism on economic issues — especially trade — but he is more on the moderate side of things in terms of environmental and social issues. He first entered the House in 2003 and has been pro-life for most of his political career. But in January 2015 he announced a conversion to the pro-choice viewpoint in what most people saw as an effort to position himself as a possible vice presidential candidate. Ryan definitely represents most Washington Democrats’ idea of what it would mean to position the party more favorably to succeed in Rust Belt states. It’s an idea that certainly has similarities with what Bernie Sanders’s internet fan base thinks Democrats should do. But Ryan — like Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown — is much less consistently liberal than Sanders, while maintaining a Sanders-ish skepticism of trade and Wall Street. Democrats very much wanted Ryan to be their nominee for the 2016 Senate race. But he declined to get in, so the party instead ran former Gov. Ted Strickland, who got crushed. Given how strong Donald Trump proved to be in the state, Ryan almost certainly would have been crushed too, so his decision to opt out seems savvy. There is a strong sentiment among a number of House backbenchers that the party would do well to replace Pelosi, simply for the sake of presenting a fresh face to voters in 2018. And on paper, a middle-aged white male Midwesterner with a history of moderation on social issues sounds like a better face to put forward in Republican-leaning districts in the midterms than an older woman from San Francisco who’s very much identified with environmentalism and social liberals. On the other hand, the energy in the Democratic Party is all on the left right now. And though there is a populist side to Ryan, it’s far from clear that he would really pass muster with the party’s left wing. But during the 2016 campaign, Ryan did offer the kind of muscular, economics-based critique of Donald Trump that many Democrats in retrospect wish Clinton had offered. Speaking at a rally in Youngstown in October, Ryan dwelled on Trump’s habit of not paying his subcontractors and said, “I don’t mean to be graphic, but this guy to our friends in the trades — to our steelworkers who he’s been treating unfairly, very unfairly — he will, he will gut you and he will walk over your cold dead body and he won’t even flinch.” Even if Ryan loses, however, a leadership run could help his career. Both Pelosi and her deputy in the Democratic leadership hierarchy, Steny Hoyer, are on the older side and won’t be around for long one way or the other. Right now relatively few House members are well-known enough to be strong future leadership candidates. A run at Pelosi could help Ryan build up his profile and position himself for later.",tim-ryan-is-going-to-challenge-nancy-pelosi-to-lead-house-democrats.txt,drew.uq
"RABAT (Reuters) - A man ran towards a car carrying the Moroccan king shortly after the arrival of Pope Francis in the North African nation on Saturday, but he was swiftly seized by security guards, live TV footage from the state broadcaster showed.  King Mohammed VI was standing up in the open-top car waving at crowds lining a street in Rabat, traveling in a motorcade alongside the pope’s vehicle. The king’s car sped up slightly but there was no other sign of disruption.  It was not immediately clear what the man was trying to do.

"This story was originally published in November, 2015.  Is there anything better in this crazy, fucked-up world than sipping on a glass of smooth mezcal? How about if you are quietly sticking it to Donald Trump and everything he stands for at the same time? John Rexer, the founder of Ilegal Mezcal, certainly doesn't think so, and he's willing to let the whole world know that neither he nor his mezcal are going to stand for right-wing anti-immigrant rhetoric. In July, his company launched a guerrilla smear campaign against the Republican candidate, wheat-pasting thousands of anti-Trump posters all over New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oaxaca. The posters simply read ""Donald Eres Un Pendejo""—""Donald, You're an Asshole""—alongside a silhouette of the most infamous hair in politics. When Trump recently hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live, the small-scale mezcal company stepped up its tactics and projected the ""pendejo"" image all over the Rockefeller Center and Union Square in New York. MUNCHIES caught up with Rexer to find out how his campaign is going, and why he decided to use his mezcal brand as a political tool against Trump. MUNCHIES: Before we dive into politics, tell me a little bit about your mezcal. John Rexer: For starters, you get a mouthful of agave with only a little bit of smoke with our mezcal. This, along with the fact that we are one of only two brands which are aging mezcales into reposados and añejos, distinguishes our mezcal from a lot of other ones. Also, with us, it is all about sustainability. We're not the type of mezcal company who ""gives back"" after we make a lot of money. If you tend to your own garden and take care of it [from] the start, giving back is not always necessary, especially if you start out the right way. We pay above-market rate to all of our producers for everything, and we personally see to it that it passes on to their workers and their families. Lastly, we pay our producers up front, instead of paying in 60 to 90 days like a lot of other mezcal brands. It's a really nice way to work. What was the exact a-ha! moment that made you realize ""Donald, eres un pendejo"" would be your next slogan? I was in New York and I had just come from Mexico. I was in Jackson Hole in the Upper West Side, having a really hungover brunch. I was sitting outside and saw a delivery server on a bicycle. I said to the person next to me, I bet you they are from Puebla or Oaxaca. So when the server came over I asked him, ""Where are you from?"" He said, ""Puebla."" We then talked about the beauty of Puebla, since I used to live in the outskirts there and it is such a cool state in Mexico. I also told him how I love the food of Puebla. The server turned to me and said, ""Man, it's good to know that everybody is not like Donald Trump."" You [could] see some real hurt in his face when he said that. I told him, ""Listen, everybody is not like Donald and most people don't feel the way he feels."" So he responded, ""Donald es un pendejo."" That moved me and I wrote it down in a napkin. I then thought that there are probably a lot of other people in New York, Oaxaca, and the US who are probably feeling the same way and are hurt by him. The next morning, I opened up my wallet and the crumpled napkin fell out. That was when it hit me: These words exactly were going to be our next campaign. I just wanted to voice the sentiment of many of the hardworking people who work with me from all over Mexico. Three days later, we had at least 1,000 posters plastered all over New York City alone. We've since branched out our campaign to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, and Oaxaca. And we're not quite done yet. I think we just hit our 2,000-poster count today. How was the general reaction to the posters from people? Most people have responded with a ""fuck yeah"" attitude—like thousands of people. One or two people have questioned our motive. Let's be really clear: It is publicity and I did use company money for this. On the other hand, let's also be really clear: This is something that we believe in. We strongly believe in the power of art and humor as protest. Especially with somebody like Trump, we take issue with him entirely. We take an issue with his entire xenophobic, money-dominated worldview. Is this Ilegal Mezcal's first foray into activism?  We've always been political. This brand started out of this bar in Guatemala, where I live. I've published a political magazine out of there, long before this. We've always been about making a crosscultural stand and movement. . A couple of years ago, we did a protest against Chick-fil-A and did stencil art to protest them when [they] came out against marriage equality. We created this stencil, which depicted two roosters kissing each other, with the phrase, ""I'd rather kiss a cock than eat your chicken."" We spraypainted that all over over New York. Have you heard anything from Trump or his people?  We have not heard back. But we did get kicked out by the police when my brand director and niece, Kayla Rexer, projected this image on Rockefeller Center the day he hosted Saturday Night Live. What was that like?  We went early and we joined around 200 protesters. We continued to project our billboard-sized image for 30 minutes until the cops found out about us and gave us a warning. After we got kicked out, we went on to project the image at Union Square and the CNN building. Do you have any words for him, just in case he's reading this?  Take a shot and chill out. Building walls and blocking out people is not the way to look at the immigration issue. How about your provide an intelligent dialogue instead? This is more appropriate for anyone who wants to be a leader of a country. Also, just just go away. Thanks for speaking with me.",this-mezcal-company-thinks-donald-trump-is-a-pendejo.txt,drew.uq

"In 2020, China will fully roll out its controversial social credit score. Under the system, both financial behaviors like “frivolous spending” and bad behaviors like lighting up in smoke-free zones can result in stiff consequences. Penalties include loss of employment and educational opportunities, as well as transportation restrictions. Those with high scores get perks, like discounts on utility bills and faster application processes to travel abroad. China is currently piloting the program and some citizens have already found themselves banned from traveling or attending certain schools due to low scores. These ramifications have led to a flurry of recent criticism from both human rights groups and the press. This week alone, news outlets like Business Insider and National Public Radio weighed in on China’s social credit score and the stratified society it may foster in the communist country. The outcry about China’s social credit score is understandable, given that the country’s authoritarian regime leaves citizens with little recourse to challenge the new system. But concerns about China’s credit system have overlooked how the US system also divides consumers along class lines — and has done so for decades. Social behaviors may not factor into US credit scores, but the idea that a person’s financial history reflects trustworthiness has long influenced employment decisions and other factors that affect Americans’ quality-of-life. China first announced that it would be devising a “social credit score” in 2014. The government said then that the system would help ensure a model society in which “sincerity and trustworthiness become conscious norms of action among all the people.” According to NPR, the fact that most Chinese people don’t have bank accounts or credit histories likely spurred the government to create a credit system of some sort. Every citizen starts off with a score of 1,000. NPR reported the ranking as follows: 960 to 1,000 is an A; 850 to 955 points is a B; 840 to 600 is a C; and any score below that is a D, which designates the score-holder as “untrustworthy.” While the government hasn’t made the specific methodology used to calculate scores public, one’s ranking can fall for both major and minor infractions. Serious violations include drunk-driving, embezzlement, and fraud. Much smaller violations that result in a lowered score include playing too many video games; spreading “fake news,” especially related to terrorist attacks, or refusing military service, will also lower one’s score. Sometimes people are declared “dishonest” for committing infractions the government doesn’t believe they’re truly sorry for. Chinese lawyer Li Xiaolin found himself in this predicament last year, according to Human Rights Watch: “He tried to use his national identity card to purchase a plane ticket. To his surprise, the online system rejected it, saying he had been blacklisted by China’s top court. Mr. Li checked the court’s website: His name was on a list of ‘untrustworthy’ people.” The courts are supposed to warn citizens before they’re added to the blacklist, allowing them 10 days to appeal the designation, but Li said he was caught by surprise. He was blacklisted for losing a defamation suit that was brought against him; he wrote an apology letter to the court as a means of making amends, and said he didn’t know that the court rejected his apology until the travel mishap. Ultimately, he had to apologize to the government again to be removed from the travel blacklist. “Chinese government authorities clearly hope to create a reality in which bureaucratic pettiness could significantly limit people’s rights,” explains Human Rights Watch. “As President Xi Jinping’s power grows, and as the system approaches full implementation, more abuses will come.” The social credit score has been compared to the “Nosedive” episode of Netflix’s Black Mirror in which everyone receives a social ranking determined by peers. It has also drawn comparisons to the dystopian novel 1984. For those declared “untrustworthy,” the ability to buy business-class train tickets or to lodge at certain hotels can be rescinded. In some cases, the opportunity for their children to attend their preferred high school or college may be taken away, as may employment opportunities. (The government encourages employers to consult the blacklist before making hiring decisions.) Citizens who behave inconsiderately in public, like walking their dogs off-leash, can have their dogs confiscated and be required to take an exam to get the pets back. Although “untrustworthy” people are punished for bad scores, citizens who rank the highest in the new system can take advantage of perks like business discounts or booking hotel rooms without deposits. “Under the system, the elite will gain access to better social privileges and those who rank closer to the bottom will effectively be second-class citizens,” Newsweek reported about the social credit score. In the United States, the credit bureaus don’t downgrade consumers for spending on things they deem silly or for being neglectful pet owners. But credit rankings in the US are set up in such a way that people with more resources get more financial breaks while people with fewer resources are routinely punished — often in ways that make little sense. A person may end up with bad credit because he lost his job, but the fact that his credit suffered while unemployed could effectively prevent him from landing another job. According to the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, it is not illegal for employers to deny an applicant a job offer based on information in his credit report. This makes it that much harder for people with bad credit to get the gainful employment needed to repair their scores. People with poor credit may also be turned down for housing, even if the reason for the would-be tenant’s troublesome credit history has nothing to do with her rental history. Someone who consistently paid rent on time but racked up credit card debt due to medical expenses could find her housing application denied or be asked to pay a higher deposit as punishment. By some estimates, one in five Americans has unpaid medical debt, and more than half of blacks and Latinos have medical debt on their credit cards. This not only limits rental opportunities but opportunities to buy a home, as good credit is generally a requirement for a housing loan. And lenders, of course, have historically created barriers for people of color pursuing homeownership. Transportation and credit aren’t just linked in China but in the US too. Americans with bad credit pay more for car insurance than their counterparts with good credit. Some banks have systematically given people of color subprime auto loans, even if their credit history didn’t justify that they pay more interest. “Credit reports and scores are mirrors of our manifestly two-tiered financial system, and more broadly our system of racial wealth inequality and unequal opportunity,” Sarah Ludwig, founder and co-director of the New Economy Project wrote in a 2015 Guardian essay. “In our culture, indebtedness — and certainly failure to pay one’s debts — is deeply entwined with concepts of morality. The insidious notion that our credit history speaks to our reliability as human beings is largely taken for granted.” The 2019 debut of the UltraFICO score, an alternative to the traditional FICO credit score, is being touted as a potential remedy for the inequities in the US credit system. Rather than focus on length of credit history, for example, it takes into consideration whether one saves regularly, maintains a $400 bank balance, avoids overdrafts, and pays bills on time. But this alternative isn’t likely to benefit the low-income people who have to juggle bills to survive, perhaps paying the heating bill late one month and the car insurance late the next. For truly cash-poor families, regularly saving money or avoiding overdraft fees is a Herculean task. In fact, many poor people forgo bank accounts altogether because banking fees take such a toll on their finances. UltraFico might help people of average means with short credit histories, but it’s questionable if the score will change circumstances for the underprivileged. Given how interlinked morality, debt, and credit are in the United States, some of the concerns about China’s new social credit score comes across as disingenuous. Although the system certainly raises alarms — Human Rights Watch is concerned about it, after all — the idea that the US credit system operates much more equitably is shortsighted.

"Dealing with themes of surveillance, personal and shared space, and what defines home in film, installation, and more. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads In the months leading up to the 15th edition of the Istanbul Biennial, posters —hung in windows alongside “For Rent” signs and pasted next to broadsides advertising concerts — began asking the city’s residents some very personal questions: Is a good neighbor someone you rarely see? Is a good neighbor richer or poorer than you? Is a good neighbor willing to babysit your 5-year-old?  Part introspective canvassing, part marketing campaign, 40 individual questions galvanized Elmgreen & Dragset’s theme for the 2017 edition: What makes a good neighbor? The Scandinavian artist duo (the Biennial’s first artist-curators) decided to approach this edition with broad notions of community and its many trappings: neighbors, borders, politics — even how we formulate our own homes. 55 artists were selected to exhibit across six venues (which, unlike the Biennial’s last edition, are each within neighborly walking distance), responding however they saw fit.   Of course, there are no right answers to these questions; still, many successful artworks in the Biennial bear out personal, global, and political identities, tackling what it means to be part (or, not part) of a community in myriad ways and media. Here are three of the questions posed by Elmgreen & Dragset, and a selection of Biennial artworks that probe them with possible “answers.”  Is a good neighbor a stranger you don’t fear? Security and surveillance play an introductory role in the biennial — as is now common practice at art institutions across the world, it is unsurprising that the first thing to greet you at any given venue is a security guard, sometimes followed by a metal detector or x-ray. Turkish ceramicist Burçak Bingöl has brilliantly intervened in daily acts of surveillance by installing ceramic CCTV cameras amidst the venues’ actual cameras in “Follower 2017.” Bedecked with local flora beneath a sheen of glaze, they are a subtle wink to those who look up and spot them — and a reminder that, as you ponder her ornamental additions, someone is most likely inspecting your image on a screen nearby. At the Galata Greek Primary School, Lungiswa Gqunta’s “Lawn I” (2016/2017) is a tightly packed grid of jagged, overturned Coke bottles, filled with a neon green petrol. Taking up most of an old classroom, “Lawn I” comments on the outdoor leisure areas of her native South Africa — reserved for the wealthy, suburban elites, the garden becomes a realm of disparity between residential populations. Shards of glass often top the fencing that keeps “strangers” out of these gardens— here the glass and its threatening edges form the basis of a charge piece of oft-disputed property, and visitors tread lightly, navigating ideas of neighborhood. In a room at Istanbul Modern, Candeğer Furtun’s “Untitled” (1994-96), confronts visitors with a line of naked, male legs, sat body-less, on a span of tiles. Immediately, you’re in a hammam, nine identity-less men sat side by side,  and one ceramic hand placed firmly (aggressively?) on a thigh. It’s at once impersonal and intimate, and we are left wondering how these figures may relate to one another, and how masculinity operates in their world — it’s no accident that there are nine figures here, representing Turkey and its eight regional neighbors. Is a good neighbor just some shadows cast on the rolled down blinds next door?  Over at Ark Kultur, Mahmoud Khaled’s “Proposal for a House Museum of an Unknown Crying Man” (2017) introduces a neighborhood stranger — the “unknown crying man.” The entire cultural space has been transformed into his home, and an audio guide illuminates the life of its sole inhabitant: one of the 52 Egyptian men arrested on a gay party boat floating down the Nile in 2001.  Here, Khaled re-imagines the future of one of these men, in Istanbul, through an incredibly detailed assemblage of furniture, books, magazines, and photographs, many of which speak to his queer identity, and hint at the personal reasoning behind his somewhat reclusive life. In the glass shower room, the only place neighbors could catch a glimpse of the crying man, scenes from the Egyptian film All My Life (dir. Maher Sabry, 2008), loops continuously on a television screen, showing the story of a gay man’s arrest; in his study, a selection of queer literature is stacked alongside the daybed. Though homosexuality is not illegal in Turkey, the house tour is a powerful and painfully personal study of continued persecution in the region — even in the crying man’s new home. Is a good neighbor tuned in to the same channel as you, watching from a sofa almost like yours, bought from a similar chain store? Tucked away in an apartment building, Yoğunluk’s Artist Atelier is the smallest of the Biennial’s six venues, showcasing “The House” (2017). Only three or four visitors can enter the darkened space at a time, and soon, the darkness give ways to soft illuminations of typical homewares. The building, some 100 years old, provides its own creaky soundtrack, and gives off a haunted house vibe, enhanced by the sticky counters, tables, and chairs, all covered in a film of sweaty latex. Surreal and familiar at the same time, the quiet, four-minute experience forces us to ponder the atelier’s question: “How do you figure out that somewhere is a house?” At Istanbul Modern, Volkan Aslan’s three-channel film, “Home Sweet Home” (2017), is a quietly beautiful meditation on personal and shared space, which takes place on the Bosphorus. To the left, woman moves about a cosy, compact living area: repotting a plant, filling a water glass, rolling a cigarette. To the right, a woman sits on the deck of a boat, taking her coffee at a desk firmly planted onboard. In the middle, rolling shots of the river link the two, but it’s not until the film nears its end that we see these two women share a single houseboat. It’s a play with forced perspective that confounds distance, and, after viewers are done chuckling at their own assumptions, leaves space to muse on the way distance functions within relationships, inside and outside the home. The 15th Istanbul Biennial continues through November 12.  ",the-istanbul-biennial-examines-the-tricky-question-of-what-makes-a-good-neighbor.txt,drew.uq
"Los Angeles public school teachers have reached a tentative deal with city leaders to end a strike that has shut down the nation’s second-largest school district for more than a week. As part of the deal, teachers would get a 6 percent raise and slightly fewer students in each classroom, according to Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of United Teachers Los Angeles, a labor union that represents about 34,000 public school teachers, nurses, librarians, and support staff in the city. “We have seen over the last week something pretty amazing happen,” Caputo-Pearl said at a press conference Tuesday morning at City Hall. “The creativity, innovation, passion, and love and emotion of our members was out on the street for everyone to see.” He was joined at the press conference by LA Mayor Eric Garcetti and District Superintendent Austin Beutner. The group said they reached a deal after an all-night negotiating session that ended at 6:15 am. The deal includes hiring more nurses, guidance counselors, librarians, and support staff. The district will also try to limit the expansion of charters schools and will reevaluate testing requirements. Union members still need to vote on the contract before ending their strike, which has now lasted six days. If union and school board members ratify the contract, classes will resume on Wednesday and more than 600,000 students can return to school. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, called the agreement a “paradigm shift.” “For the first time in recent memory, the conversation has focused on how to fund our schools so students have the support they need,” Weingarten told me. The deal follows a week of tense negotiating between teachers and school officials, who felt added pressure as the strike gained national — and even international — attention. Teachers pointed out that California is one of the wealthiest states in the country but ranks toward the bottom in how much money it invests per student. It’s unclear how much more money the state plans to funnel to its largest school district, but the strike certainly pushed local and state officials to hustle. “The strike was painful and it had a cost, but it helped,” Garcetti said during Tuesday’s press conference. The strike’s success adds new momentum to a national movement to boost investment in public education. Frustration over stagnant teacher wages, crumbling infrastructure, and deep budget cuts to education fueled a wave of teacher protests in conservative states in 2018. Educators went on strike in Arizona, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Oklahoma, forcing state lawmakers to raise their pay and spend more on schools. The strike in Los Angeles suggests that the movement is expanding beyond the red states where it began, and could lead more progressive states to reexamine their investment in public education too. With 640,000 students, Los Angeles has the second-largest school district in the US (behind only New York City). Much of the student population is poor and underserved — about 80 percent of kids qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. Yet California is among the states that spend the least on each student (adjusted for the cost of living), largely because of the state’s strict limits on property tax rates. Union leaders and school district officials had spent more than a year negotiating a new contract but made little progress. Beutner, the school district’s superintendent, repeatedly blasted union leaders for trying “bankrupt” the city with its expensive proposals. The teachers union has demanded a number of changes, including smaller class sizes; limited standardized testing; more support staff, such as nurses, librarians, and academic counselors; and a 6.5 percent salary increase. The union also wants the state to limit the expansion of public charter schools — privately run schools that receive state funding but are subject to fewer regulations. Negotiations stalled even after teachers, nurses, and librarians voted in August to authorize a strike. It wasn’t until teachers walked out of class last week, shutting down every public school in the city, that talks began to move forward. On Thursday, Gavin Newsom, California’s new Democratic governor, proposed a $209 billion budget that would increase school spending; school district officials also agreed to make some changes to classroom sizes and teacher salaries. Union leaders rejected the offer on Friday, calling it “woefully inadequate.” After spending the weekend back at the negotiating table, there was a breakthrough. On the surface, the deal appears to address most of the teachers’ concerns, though class sizes will only shrink by about four students — one each year for the next four years. The city’s middle and high school teachers currently have an average of 32 students in each classroom, double the national average. During the press conference, Garcetti described the deal as “historic,” while the schools superintendent struck a more cautious tone. “We can’t solve 40 years of underinvestment in education in one week or one contract,” Beutner said. Teachers and other union members are expected to vote Tuesday to approve the contract. If it fails, they go back to the table to strike another deal. If it passes, and the school board approves it, teachers will go back to work Wednesday.",la-teachers-strike-teachers-and-city-leaders-reach-tentative-deal.txt,drew.uq

"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google on Friday announced a new subsea cable dubbed “Equiano” that will connect Africa with Europe, as it boosts its cloud computing infrastructure.  Equiano, fully funded by Google, is the company’s third private international cable.  The search engine giant, which has invested $47 billion in improving its global technology infrastructure over the last three years, said Equiano is the company’s 14th subsea cable investment globally.  “Equiano will be the first subsea cable to incorporate optical switching at the fiber-pair level, rather than the traditional approach of wavelength-level switching,” Google said in a blog post.  Google said a contract to build the cable with Alcatel Submarine Networks was signed in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the first phase of the project, connecting South Africa with Portugal, is expected to be completed in 2021.  The company in April completed the “Curie” project, its first private intercontinental cable, connecting Chile to Los Angeles.  It also announced last year the Dunant transatlantic submarine cable project connecting France and the United States. The 6,600 km cable is scheduled to come into service in 2020.  Subsea cables form the backbone of the internet by carrying 99 percent of the world’s data traffic.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Bank for International Settlements (BIS) chief Agustin Carstens has urged top central banks to preserve their ammunition for more serious economic downturns rather than deplete it chasing higher growth.  Presenting the annual report of the Swiss-based BIS, dubbed the central bank for the world’s central banks, Carstens told reporters any easing needed to be considered carefully and done sparingly.   “We would stress that it is important to preserve some room for maneuver for more serious downturns,” he said.  That message comes just weeks before the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to confirm a U-turn in global monetary policy and cut interest rates for first time since the financial crisis a decade ago.  Japan and China have both signaled their readiness to ease further and the European Central Bank, which only halted bond buying in December, indicated this month that it could cut its rates even deeper into negative territory.  While U.S.-China trade tensions have weighed on economic sentiment this year many developed countries had recovered to potential or above potential growth rates, Carstens said. Inflation was mostly not that far from target ranges either.  That raised the question of how forthcoming central banks should be with any additional accommodation.   “Monetary policy should be considered more as a backstop rather than as a spearhead of a strategy to induce higher sustainable growth,” Carstens said.  He also warned that sustained use rendered policies like negative rates or quantitative easing less effective. “How much more stimulus will you get if rates are reduced by another 25 basis points? That will produce a lower profile of bang for that buck,” Carstens said.   The message to conserve firepower from the BIS is not surprising. Until this year it had been urging top central banks to press on with raising rates or at least move away from crisis-era stimulus programs.  The annual report’s primary call was for a better balance to be struck between monetary policy, structural reforms, government fiscal policy and macroprudential measures that encompass regulation of banks and other financial institutions.  Carstens also said the possible short-term gain of lowering borrowing costs had to be balanced against the “potential risks in terms of asset misallocation and asset mispricing and financial stability risks as we move forward”.  The sharp change in direction from the Fed and others this year has seen global markets rocket since January.  Last year’s big drops in European, Asian and eventually U.S. stocks have been replaced by a near 20 percent leap in the S&P 500 and China’s biggest markets, reviving hopes the decade-long global bull-run may not have ended after all.  Global stocks have reflated by roughly $8 trillion, emerging markets have done well even as China’s economy has revealed cracks, yet yields on ultra-safe government bonds like U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds have plunged dramatically.  Claudio Borio, the head of the BIS Monetary and Economic Department, acknowledged that markets had become dependent on accommodative monetary policy and weaning them off that dependence could cause “withdrawal symptoms”.  Following fierce criticism of the Federal Reserve by U.S. President Donald Trump, he also stressed the importance of central bank independence.   “The autonomy of central banks is an important asset and it is an asset that tends to come under threat when it is most needed,” he told Reuters.  “Of course these are challenging times politically for central banks but it is clearly not helpful to try to interfere with their decisions.”  Another of the annual report’s warnings was of a rapid build up of corporate debt via collateralized loan obligations (CLO) and other forms of credit that do not go through the normal regulated banking channels.  It had turned on “some warning lights” Carstens said, having similarities to the steep rise in collateralized debt obligations (CDO) that amplified the U.S. subprime crisis more than a decade ago. The banking sector is now better capitalized, however, he said.

"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - In 1993, Congressman Jair Bolsonaro strode to a podium in Brazil’s lower house and delivered a speech that shook its young democracy: He declared his love for the country’s not-so-distant military regime and demanded the legislature be disbanded.  “Yes, I’m in favor of a dictatorship!” Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, thundered at fellow lawmakers, some of whom had joined guerrilla groups to battle the junta that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. “We will never resolve grave national problems with this irresponsible democracy!”   On Sunday, Brazilians will cast ballots in a presidential election that could elevate Bolsonaro to the head of the world’s fifth most populous country. A political gadfly who has flitted through nine minor parties in a 27-year career, his views have changed little since that day in the capital of Brasilia.  But his jeremiad message – that Brazil is a dysfunctional basket case that needs an iron-fisted ruler to restore order – is resonating with Brazilians dispirited by the nation’s soaring crime, moribund economy and entrenched political corruption.  Violent criminals? Bolsonaro says shoot them all. Political enemies? Them too. Corruption? A military coup will drain the swamp if the judicial system won’t, he says. The economy? Bolsonaro wants to privatize state-run companies to keep politicians away from the till.  The 63-year-old is surging. He leads a crowded field of 13 candidates heading into the first round of elections on Oct. 7 with 35 percent of likely votes, according to the latest survey by polling firm Datafolha. If no candidate wins a majority, the top two vote-getters will go head-to-head on Oct. 28. Pollsters give Bolsonaro a roughly 30-percent chance of winning the race outright this weekend; some say privately his chances might be even better than that.  If there is a second round, Bolsonaro’s opponent is likely to be Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers Party. Datafolha shows them tied in a potential runoff.  Many Brazilians are sounding alarms about Bolsonaro’s autocratic views and those of his vice-presidential running mate, recently retired Army general Hamilton Mourao, who says Brazil’s Constitution can be torn up and rewritten without input from citizens.  Then there are the federal hate speech charges leveled against Bolsonaro for his racist, homophobic and misogynist rants. His highlight reel includes a spat with a congresswoman whom Bolsonaro said was not attractive enough for him to rape.  Bolsonaro’s campaign did not respond to Reuters’ requests for an interview.  But supporters insist that tens of millions of Brazilians are silently rooting for Bolsonaro, even if some will not admit it to friends or pollsters.  Brazilians from all walks of life applaud his vow to make life miserable for armed gangs that have made them prisoners in their own homes. Many welcome his promise to loosen gun laws so average citizens can protect themselves. Business people like his recent embrace of free-market economics.  Young people are enthralled by his caustic put-downs of rivals on social media. Polls show Bolsonaro is performing well with female voters, despite being labeled a misogynist by many.  Evangelical Christians, who comprise a quarter of the electorate, are particularly enamored of Bolsonaro, a Catholic who has promised to rid schools of sex education, derail gay rights and thwart any attempts to loosen strict abortion laws. Some see his recent survival of a near-fatal knife attack on the campaign trail as a sign that Bolsonaro, whose middle name Messias means “Messiah,” was sent by God to lead them.  Others view him as the only option to prevent the return to power of the Workers Party, or PT, whose founder, former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva, is serving a 12-year prison sentence for graft and money laundering.  Teenager Gilson Barbosa Silva, who hails from a tough district of Sao Paulo, says his disgust with the PT is such that he will begrudgingly vote for Bolsonaro, a member of the Social Liberal Party.  “The options are depressing … (but) he is the only fresh option,” the heavily tattooed 18-year-old said.  Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a leading Sao Paulo business school, said Bolsonaro has deftly capitalized on polarization that has deepened with Lula’s downfall.  “The roots of his support are in the political radicalization that has flourished in Brazil,” Melo said. “Jair Bolsonaro is a symbol of this transition.”  Some pundits call Bolsonaro a “Tropical Trump” because of his large social media following, pugnacious demeanor and multiple wives. Steve Bannon, the U.S. president’s campaign guru, has likewise advised Bolsonaro.  But longtime political observers of Brazil – where full democracy has been the exception to a succession of authoritarian regimes in the last century – say Bolsonaro is a unique creation raised in the long shadow of the country’s most recent dictatorship.   Bolsonaro celebrated his ninth birthday just days before the 1964 coup. The son of an untrained dentist, he opted for the military and in 1977 graduated from the Black Needles Military Academy, Brazil’s equivalent of West Point.  His Army career was undistinguished. Bolsonaro landed in the brig for a couple of weeks in 1986 after a Brazilian news magazine published his complaints about paltry military pay. But his words tapped into widespread discontent among rank-and-file soldiers. He parlayed that support into a seat on Rio de Janeiro’s city council in 1988, then a spot in Congress two years later.  Bolsonaro’s legislative achievements are thin: He has authored just two bills that became law. Still, he has never been tarnished by corruption.  Now, after nearly three decades in politics, Bolsonaro is riding a tsunami of voter frustration that may carry him to the presidency.  Brazil is still hobbling from its worst recession in decades; 13 million are unemployed. Crime has exploded and drug violence has touched every corner of the country. Last year saw nearly 64,000 murders, the most on record. The epic bribery investigation that jailed Lula exposed a pay-to-play political culture of staggering proportions.  Disgust with Brazil’s leaders is palpable. Only 13 percent of Brazilians are “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with democracy overall, according to the most recent annual poll by Latinobarometro, a Chilean think tank.  That toxic environment has Bolsonaro’s backers, much like U.S. voters who sent Donald Trump to the White House, hoping he will be a walking grenade that explodes the system from within.  “If he can lessen graft and get rid of the old, corrupt foxes who rule our political system, then four years from now we will have more candidates who put Brazil’s interests above their own,” said Raphael Enohata, a 26-year-old graduate engineering student at the University of Sao Paulo. “He is just the beginning of the transition we want.”  Drug gangs are also high on Bolsonaro’s hit list.  “We cannot treat criminals like normal human beings who need to be respected,” Bolsonaro said in August. He said law enforcement should pump suspects with “10, 15 or 30” bullets each, then “be given awards” for their efforts.  A few days later at a rally, Bolsonaro grabbed a cameraman’s tripod and mimicked shooting a rifle. “We are going to gun down all these Workers Party supporters!” he shouted as the crowd cheered wildly.  His campaign said it was a joke. But Bolsonaro is serious about what he sees as his destiny.  “God called me to this race,” he said upon accepting his party’s nomination. “My mother gave me the middle name Messiah. But I alone will not be the savior of the Brazil. Who will save it is all of us, together.”   Reporting by Brad Brooks; Editing by Marla Dickerson",a-disciple-of-brazils-dictatorship-moves-closer-to-the-presidency.txt,drew.uq
"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin may have spent years reviling America, but Russians  hoping Donald Trump will usher in a new era of detente marked his inauguration on Friday with parties and trinkets from commemorative coins to “matryoshka” nesting dolls in his image.  Washington was turned into a virtual fortress with an estimated 900,000 people — backers and protesters — descending on the capital. In London, anti-Trump activists draped a banner reading “Build Bridges Not Walls” from Tower Bridge. Protests were planned across western Europe on Friday and Saturday.   But according to Gennady Gudkov, a Putin critic and former lawmaker, Russia is in the grip of “Trumpomania”, with state media giving the President-elect blanket air time at the expense of more mundane and sometimes depressing domestic news stories.  That, he said, was in part because the U.S. election, unlike elections in Russia, had been unpredictable. The Kremlin is hoping Trump will ease sanctions imposed over the annexation of Crimea, team up with Russia against Islamic State, and cut back NATO military activity near Russian borders.  Craftsmen in the city of Zlatoust, east of Moscow, have released a limited series of silver and gold commemorative coins, engraved with “In Trump We Trust” - an allusion to the phrase on U.S. banknotes “In God We Trust”.  Sellers of traditional matryoshka nesting dolls have added Trump dolls to their popular line-up of items carved in the likeness of President Vladimir Putin, Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, ex-President Mikhail Gorbachev and Josef Stalin.  And a shop selling Russian military kit located opposite the U.S. embassy in Moscow has unveiled a cheeky promotional campaign offering embassy employees and U.S. citizens a 10 percent discount on its wares to celebrate Trump’s inauguration.  Some of Trump’s opponents believe the Kremlin helped him win the White House by staging a hacking campaign to hoover up embarrassing information about Hillary Clinton, his rival. The Kremlin denies that, but few here make any secret of the fact that they are pleased that Trump and not Clinton triumphed.    Relations between Putin and Barack Obama had soured badly.    “Trump’s election has generated enormous enthusiasm in Russia because his warm words about Russia and Putin have given us hope that the USA and the West will stop their attack on Russia,” Sergei Markov, a former pro-Putin lawmaker, said on social media.  “We don’t know for sure if there will be an improvement (in relations) or not. But we Russians are optimists ... so we are hoping for the best, while preparing for the worst.”  For Russian nationalists, Trump’s inauguration is an excuse to mix fun with self-promotion.  They are holding an all-night party at what used to be the main Soviet-era post office in Moscow where they will showcase their favorite prop, a  triptych of Putin, Trump and French Front National leader Marine Le Pen.  Konstantin Rykov, a former pro-Putin lawmaker and one of the event’s promoters, said on social media it was right to celebrate the first phase of the “New World Order.”        “Washington will be ours,” he quipped.

"ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s prime minister and economy minister have formed an unofficial alliance with the president to prevent the euro zone’s third-largest economy being dragged into financial crisis by its ruling parties, sources say.  Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, both technocrat appointees, have held private conversations with President Sergio Mattarella in recent days on ways of shielding Italy from a gathering political and financial storm, according to two Italian officials with knowledge of the matter.  Conte and Tria are acting with Mattarella, who has a role in ensuring political stability, to effectively curb the behavior of their own government — a populist coalition whose party leaders are railing against EU budget rules.  The coalition’s confrontation with the European Commission, which has flagged possible disciplinary action over Rome’s big-spending fiscal policies, has sent a shiver through Italian bonds and rekindled fears of a full-blown financial crisis.  “Mattarella is trying to keep the boat afloat,” said one senior government official.  Though the coalition’s dominant political force is League leader Matteo Salvini, the prime minister is in charge of negotiating with Brussels over budget policy, and both he and Tria could do serious damage to the government if they were to wield the ultimate political weapon.  Both Salvini and his coalition partner Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star party, know that the resignations of two men seen by markets as Italy’s main guarantee of fiscal prudence would be likely to send the value of its debt tumbling, and neither wants to risk this.  Conte has already threatened this week to resign, saying EU rules should be respected. Tria, a former academic, told Reuters that daily quarrels between Salvini and Di Maio were damaging Italy.  “What’s going on is weakening my negotiating power with the EU,” Tria said on the sidelines of a ceremony at the Quirinale presidential palace. “It means that Italy is not a country that can be taken seriously.”  As for Mattarella - the presidency is mostly a figurehead role, but it has the power during political crises to make or break governments. Neither the League nor 5-Star would want to make an enemy of the president.  The League, rooted in rich northern regions, and 5-Star, whose voters mainly live in the poorer south, forged their alliance a year ago, but last month’s European Parliament elections have given Salvini the upper hand.  The League doubled its vote from the 2018 general election and Salvini has been acting as de facto prime minister, vowing not to bow to budget pressure from Brussels. On Thursday, Di Maio agreed to back the League’s tax-cutting plan as a priority.  With a debt of 2.3 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion), Italy is viewed by most economists as too big to fail, and financial instability there could endanger the stability of the entire euro zone.   “The main concern of the president is who will draw up the 2020 budget and what’s in Salvini’s mind,” said another official.  The fact that Italian debt continues to rise as a proportion of GDP prompted the European Commission on Wednesday to start a process that could lead to financial sanctions and stricter oversight of fiscal policy.  Investors are already asking for interest rates some 0.7 percentage points higher than a year ago to buying Italian 10-year sovereign bonds.  In October, the gap between Italian 10-year bond yields and those from Germany, the euro zone’s benchmark, spiked to over 3.4 percentage points after the EU rejected the government’s 2019 budget. A compromise defused the crisis - but another showdown between Rome and Brussels would send these premiums soaring again.  The worst-case scenario for Mattarella would be a government collapse later this year that prevented the approval of the 2020 budget by the end of December, as required by law.  One of the top officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said that Brussels had asked Rome to cut its 2019 deficit by around 0.2 percentage points of GDP, or some 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion).  “We need to stop talking against Europe and show convincing numbers over the deficit and debt trends,” this official said.  Late last year, Tria, Conte and Mattarella, backed by Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco, succeeded in persuading Salvini and Di Maio to trim the 2019 deficit target to avoid EU fines. Visco also has a direct line to his predecessor and current head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi.  Conte’s office said on Wednesday that Italy’s deficit-to-GDP ratio for 2019 was already set to come in at 2.1%, well below the official 2.4% target.  Salvini’s growing self-confidence has fueled speculation that he will abandon 5-Star and seek a new election, though he has denied this. But he may not be in a mood to make another compromise on his anti-austerity budget plans.  The League’s economics chief, Claudio Borghi, told Reuters this week that it had only agreed to back down in December because it was the junior partner. The EU vote showed it was now the top dog, he said.  Editing by Kevin Liffey",moderate-leaders-try-to-protect-italy--from-their-own-government.txt,drew.uq

"Kourtney Kardashian and Younes Bendjima's split is not a done, DONE deal just yet ... based on the fact they're getting closer again in public. Kourt chopped it up with Younes Monday night outside a Malibu sushi joint. Unclear if they actually dined together, or just hooked up post-meal, but they were sitting in her Range Rover while they chatted. They had plenty of time to talk reunion, especially because Younes was behind the wheel of Kourt's whip when they drove off together. As we reported, there were rumors Younes was caught cheating after pics surfaced of him last month in Mexico with Jordan Ozuna. Our sources connected to Kourt said the breakup was more about distance between them, since they'd always had a long-distance relationship.

"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The U.S. Charge d’Affaires in Turkey visited Andrew Brunson, the evangelical pastor whose detention and trial on terrorism charges has sparked a crisis between the two countries, and repeated a call on Tuesday for his case to be resolved.  Jeffrey Hovenier, speaking outside Brunson’s home in the coastal province of Izmir where he is under house arrest, said Washington wanted the pastor’s case “as well as the case of the other unjustly detained Americans, and the Turkish national employees of the U.S. diplomatic mission” resolved fairly, swiftly and transparently.

"Though plenty of 21-year-olds consider themselves booze experts, at that age, Mariena Mercer actually was. After spending time studying the drink in Mexico, Mercer returned as a leading consultant, having fully earned the job title Tequila Goddess. Today she's head mixologist at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, a premiere hotel and casino. There she presides over a beverage production test kitchen, tinkering with ingredients and dreaming up menus for one of the largest fresh beverage programs in the world. We caught up with her to find out what and where she likes to drink in Las Vegas. VICE: You're a Las Vegas native?Mariena Mercer: Correct. I'm second generation, so both of my parents were raised here, which is a bit of a rarity. My whole family is still here, and I've lived here my whole life. I'm actually named after a casino, which is really bizarre. There used to be the Marina hotel and casino. The original building is still there. My dad was driving to the hospital and saw the Marina and fell in love with it. What was your career before coming to The Cosmopolitan?I was studying chemistry in school and started working in a steakhouse. I came from humble upbringings, so it opened up a whole other world of hospitality. We had a master sommelier. I was just fascinated and really fell in love with wine and the beverage world.How did you get the name Tequila Goddess?[At the steakhouse] we had beverage instructors from across the street at a neighboring property. They would come over and I'd just ask them a million questions about the beverage world and what they were drinking. They found it very endearing and created this job for me called the Tequila Goddess because they knew I was turning 21. I was like, ""Absolutely not. What does that mean?"" They just said, ""Go home and think about it."" I went home and studied tequila for four hours before I went to sleep and was so fascinated. That was almost 12 years ago. For my 21st birthday I went out to the town of Tequila and got to live intermittently at different distilleries and travel and really immerse myself into every part of the process. I fell in love with the culture. I fell in love with everything about it. I came home and I was going to be one of the leading experts in tequila in the states at that time because no one was doing a deep dive into it like I was. I started getting hired to do a lot of consulting across the country. From there I went into bartending and bartended at several properties on the Strip. I dropped out of college and decided that's what I really wanted to do.Do you apply your chemistry background to your job now?Absolutely. I think my brain always thinks in that kind of method. I love alchemy and the way things mix, whether it's chemical or culinary or cocktails. I'm just fascinated with how things mix, or acidity, or how things become better or change speeds. I was fortunate to carve out my own style. Growing up my idols were Willy Wonka and Bill Nye the Science Guy. I'd like to think I've grown into a combination of the two. What are you working on now?I just launched The Chandelier menu, and it's my favorite I've done so far. It's whimsical and playful. It's something that I call multisensory—there's a lot of experiential cocktails as far as oils and aromas, nitrogen and edible components. Every single cocktail is a story or something very personal to me, or something I can kind of weave the cocktail around. Each one has tons of different arms and legs, but hopefully communicates the story to each guest.Where are some of your favorite places to eat and drink both on and off strip?I love Velveteen Rabbit, off the Strip. The sisters who run it are just incredible. They have a unique sense of style in every sense of that word, as far as the fashion, the design, the cocktails. Everything is such an engaging, incredible experience. It's a local bar to me, a place you can go and chat up other people. It's creative mindsets that tend to have cocktails there, so you can meet really great people in a different field who maybe have commonalities with.Where else?My next pick would be Herbs & Rye. They've got a really talented staff. Their foundation in classic cocktails is so strong, and the food is great. They call it the clubhouse, and it really does feel like one. You go in there and you know three-quarters of the room. It's always a really fun time and it can get a little debaucherous. It's a passion project for Nectaly, the owner, and I have a ton of respect for where he's come from and all of his work to make it come to fruition.What are some drink trends right now?I love sherry. I love modifying it. I love sipping sherry. I love sipping sherry with food. It really is one of my favorite spirits of all time. I think a lot of people correlate it with maybe your grandma drinking dry sherry, but once you deep dive into sherry it's such a beautiful spirit. I love sherry and I don't know if anyone does it better than José Andrés at Jaleo. It's romantic to be able to sip sherry with small bites. Sherry cocktails and sherry as a sipping component is definitely a trend.What makes Vegas unique compared to other drinking cities?Volume, but quality volume. It's been an amazing, refreshing change in the past couple of years. Six years ago when I first had my meeting with Cosmopolitan, there was such a cognitive dissonance between great restaurants where you go and you have every celebrity chef in the world making these really expensive meals with these great and quality ingredients and then you get a margarita that has a sweet and sour mix. I really wanted to elevate the quality of cocktails in Las Vegas, and I think that's really happened. It's really exciting.  Read the entire VICE Guide to Las Vegas here.

"2016 was the year of ""post fact"" news, but it was also the year of post-new news. 2016 was the year of the algorithmic timeline, in which tech companies dismantled the concept of time entirely. This year saw Facebook, Twitter and Instagram occupy the role of mainstream media publishers, whether or not they chose to admit it. Each platform instituted similar changes: their ""timeline"" would no longer display the most recent story at the top, but would use algorithms to decide on what individual users most wanted to see. Depending on our friendships and actions, the system might deliver old news, biased news, or news which had already been disproven. In many cases what we saw was speculation and rumor; stories which weren't really news at all. A (chronological) timeline of these changes would include: Not long ago social media was lauded for granting access to information, building connections and ""making the world more open and connected."" But now machines pre-empt our impulses, herding us into habits and repetition.  2016 was the year of politicians telling us what we should believe, but it was also the year of machines telling us what we should want.  In the world of Instagram, some things will always be current: organic breakfasts, taut ""bikini bodies"" and tiny adorable dogs among them. But even with a prolific following and a popular niche, creators are at the mercy of Instagram's rules.  I spoke to several well-known Instagram creators, drawing on Motherboard's ties to the Instagram corgi underworld. ""Followers have drastically declined,"" Jeri Yoshizu told me in an email, the anonymous custodian of the wildly popular Three Corgis account, which has 146,000 Instagram followers. ""We used to get 1,000 a week, now it's half that."" Keeping up with changes is a full-time job: ""They've done a good job of getting rid of crazy spammers, but it does come with a price of lower engagement.""  Khoa Phan is ""corgdad"" to Lilo (31,500 followers). He said he has experienced similar issues: ""I think my posts are a bit buried among all of the other photos. People either have to get notified that I've posted a new photo, or they have to go to the profile directly. I used to have a regular time when I would post my photos. Now that Instagram doesn't display photos chronologically, that approach seems pointless."" The only way to insure your posts gain notice is to bombard the feed and hope that some stick, which risks comprising on quality and annoying people.  Varsha Sreekumar looks after Elvis Pawsley, a dog with ""short legs"" and ""big dreams."" She saw the changes as contradictory to Instagram's ""insta"" nature, driving users to like content only if they know they'll want more of the same in future. ""I enjoyed the freedom of engaging with a piece of content without any sort of ripple effect. It really limits the discovery and exploration potential of the app."" Sreekumar added: ""Interestingly enough, the change was made after Instagram opened the doors to brands to run ads."" But even once they pay for visibility, a brand under pressure to remain engaging: ""Playing devil's advocate for a second here: All the money in the world cannot transform shitty content into good content."" What happens when users realize they're trapped in a loop? By then, will automated ""good taste"" be more sophisticated? There is a bizarre hubris to altering time, as if a person—or company—believes they are greater than physics.  The mark of the despot is to rewrite the clock and calendar: in 2002 Turkmenistan renamed the months according to the will of Saparmurat Niyazov, its ""President for Life"" (January was named for the leader himself, April was named after his mother). Last year North Korea reverted to ""Pyongyang Time,"" pushing clocks forward by thirty minutes in defiance of Japan. Finally, there are those who reinvent time as a commercial venture: Swatch decision in 1999 to launch a decimalized, centralized unit of time they called the "".beat."" intended to serve as a universal ""internet time,"" or chronological Esperanto. Today these examples are regarded as laughable. But social media's ""New Time"" is more tenacious, because it is less obviously a break with normality. It disorients the reader, and distracts them with endless, timeless content. Today sites do not even hide their filter bubble effect: Instagram's announcement of it's newly atemporal feed, titled ""See the Moments You Care About First,"" was a masterpiece of presumptive thinking. Apparently we ""care,"" on an emotional level, about the app. Apparently we trust it to select what we see. It makes sense that social media sites would want you to forget linear time, because the more time you spend on these sites, the more you are worth to them (in this way social media is like a casino, where they change your money ""chips"" to keep you from noticing when you lose it). Time is flattened into a slideshow, a sentimental carousel.  This moves us into a different sense of time, an achronological ""lame infinity."" A place where the present is filtered to look old while the old renews itself constantly. Where rumors are powerful than news because they keep coming back until they're disproven.  Speaking to me by email, Carl Miller, Research Director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media (part of cross-party British think tank Demos), highlighted the power of these algorithms as gatekeepers of—and even replacements for—traditional media: ""The Facebook news algorithm is more powerful than any newspaper editor in the world. It may become more powerful than every newspaper editor in the world."" Capable of spreading lies just as quickly as they spread knowledge, can algorithms really be trusted with forming the worldview of social media users? Miller warned, ""The concern is that they can't resign, and don't play by professional standards; we don't even really know—as outsiders —how they work."" Where does this leave us, creators and consumers alike, gazing headlong into 2017? Perhaps soon we will get used to the algorithmic timeline, and stop expecting our news to be current. Perhaps soon we'll stop looking to consume news at all and happily continue, trapped in Throwback Thursday for the rest of (nonlinear) time.",why-2016-was-the-year-of-the-algorithmic-timeline.txt,drew.uq
"CLEVELAND — Donald Trump’s Republican convention speech had a genuinely surprising, sincere moment. It came when Trump brought up the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. He said, ""Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted [the] LGBTQ community. No good. And we're going to stop it. As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me."" The crowd cheered and clapped — not exactly a sure thing with a Republican audience when it comes to protecting LGBTQ people’s rights. And Trump, in an unscripted moment, acknowledged the crowd’s surprising reaction: ""And I have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you."" It’s long been said that Trump doesn’t care much about LGBTQ or other cultural issues. (Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel said as much in his Republican convention speech.) To the extent that Trump opposes same-sex marriage, it’s out of political convenience. This brief moment in the speech provides a sign that may be true. But the rhetoric Trump is using has some ugly roots: It’s essentially a European right-wing strategy to pit LGBTQ people against Muslims. As my colleague Dylan Matthews explained, European right-wingers often use Middle Eastern countries’ horrific records on gay rights to try to foster Islamophobic sentiments among LGBTQ communities — a sentiment they can tap into to garner restrictions on immigration from predominantly Muslim countries. It’s effectively pro-gay Islamophobia. The crowd’s reaction also does not mean that Republicans have progressed on gay rights or LGBTQ issues more broadly. Despite some LGBTQ advocates’ hopes that the party would drop these types of battles after losing on same-sex marriage, the 2016 platform includes continued opposition to marriage equality, support for North Carolina’s anti-transgender bathroom law, support for anti-LGBTQ conversion therapy, and a tacit condemnation of same-sex parents. But at the very least, the Republican convention will clap and cheer for ending anti-LGBTQ murder.",watch-donald-trump-reach-out-to-l-g-b-t-q-americans.txt,drew.uq
" One bitter cold day in early February, I stumbled out of bed and braved the Boston MBTA subway system to make it downtown for a meeting hosted by the Boston Center for Independent Living on how the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act might impact disabled people in Massachusetts who rely on Medicaid.  I sat myself in the front of a crowded room that included women in wheelchairs and men with canes. When the room went quiet, I could hear only the gentle panting of a dozen service dogs. Over the course of the next hour, the speakers got up one by one and went through the possible scenarios, while I fidgeted and frowned, taking notes when I could.  During the question-and-answer segment at the end of the seminar, a woman stood up to speak into the microphone.

"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Power returned to much of Argentina and two neighboring countries following a massive blackout that left tens of millions in the dark on Sunday, but Argentine President Mauricio Macri said the cause of the “unprecedented” outage was still unclear.  Argentina’s grid “collapsed” around 7 a.m. (1100 GMT), leaving the entire country without power, Argentina’s Energy Secretariat said. The outage also cut electricity to much of neighboring Uruguay and swaths of Paraguay, and shut down YPF SA’s La Plata refinery, Argentina’s largest.  Power had returned to nearly 90 percent of Argentina by early on Sunday evening and to virtually all of Uruguay and Paraguay, officials in each country said.  Macri´s energy secretary, Gustavo Lopetegui, told reporters earlier in the day that the blackout started with a failure in the country´s “interconnection system,” known as SADI, but said the root cause of the outage remained unknown and that results of a full investigation would not be available for 10 to 15 days.   “There was a failure in the system, the kind that happens regularly in Argentina and other countries,” said Lopetegui, adding that “a chain of events that took place later ... caused a total disruption.”  “This case is unprecedented and will be deeply investigated,” Macri said on social media.  The blackout comes amid a deepening economic crisis in Argentina that has plunged nearly a third of the country into poverty, pushed interest rates skyward and sent the peso tumbling against the dollar, prompting mass protests throughout the country.     Residents of Buenos Aires, a city of nearly 16 million, awoke on Father´s Day to a nearly entirely dark city. The blackout hobbled public transportation, cut off water supplies and crippled phone and internet communications for much of the day.   Images from social media showed long lines of cars at the few service stations still in operation in Argentina’s largest city and traffic lights dim, creating chaos in places even on a normally quiet Sunday.  “The city is a disaster. There are no traffic lights. Stores aren’t open. It spoiled Father’s Day,” said 75-year-old retiree Liliana Comis.   Speculation abounded on social media about the causes of the blackout, as well as sharp rebukes by critics of Macri, who is running for re-election later this year in a hotly contested race.  “Millions of Argentines, who have had to pay astronomical rates for electricity to benefit those in power, are still waiting for power to return to their homes,” Alberto Fernandez, a Peronist presidential candidate, said in a tweet on Sunday afternoon.  The blackout also renewed questions about the vulnerability of parts of the South American grid, which transcends borders and connects many of the region´s largest economies.  A similarly massive outage in Brazil in 2009, caused by a failure at the country´s sprawling Itaipu hydroelectric plant, cut power to tens of millions and led to calls for Brazil to beef up its energy infrastructure.  A spokesman for Argentine state oil company YPF told Reuters that its La Plata refinery, a critical link in the country’s oil infrastructure, had been temporarily shut down following the outage.   Argentina is also home to the Vaca Muerta shale formation, one of the world’s biggest reserves of shale gas and oil. It was not immediately clear to what extent drilling operations there had been affected.  Brazil, despite its connection to the Argentine grid, appeared to escape any serious impact from the blackout.   A spokesman for Brazil’s power system operator, Operador Nacional do Sistema Eletrico (ONS), told Reuters early on Sunday the outage had not affected that country.

"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday his administration wants more rigorous screening of refugees and visitors from certain countries to prevent terrorist attacks.  Here is what Trump’s order on “extreme vetting” - denounced by civil rights groups as discriminatory - includes.  The order bars the entry of foreign nationals from certain countries for 90 days. While no countries are specifically named in the order, it refers to a statute that would apply to seven Muslim-majority nations: Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Iraq. There is an exception for certain types of visas, including for diplomats and the United Nations.  The temporary halt is aimed at giving the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Director of National Intelligence time to determine what information is needed from each country to ensure that visas are not issued to individuals posing a national security threat.  The order calls for a review to create a single process for screening people entering the country, which could include holding more in-person interviews, searches of an expanded database of identity documents or longer application forms.   Under the current system, some visa applications require interviews but others do not. The government already has extensive databases but some believe they need to be expanded.        The order suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows consular officers to exempt some applicants from face-to-face interviews if they are seeking to renew their temporary visas within a year of expiration.  Immigration attorneys say the changes will make even routine applications much more complicated and time consuming and could mean that more people will need assistance to get through the visa process. In an attempt to ensure wait times for interviews are “not unduly affected,” the order calls for the hiring of more consular fellows to work in U.S. embassies abroad.   The order calls for the temporary halt of all refugee admissions for four months so the government can study the process and determine if additional checks are necessary, although there will be case-by-case exceptions.  The order also implemented a blanket ban of all Syrian refugees until “sufficient changes” have been made to the refugee program, without giving more details.  After the suspension is lifted, the government will give priority to applicants that are suffering religious-based prosecution, but only if they are minorities in their country.  Trump said in a television interview that the move would protect Christians. It could also protect ethnic minorities like the Yazidis in the Middle East. This could potentially open the door to legal challenges claiming religious discrimination, some legal experts say.  Once refugee admissions resume, fewer will be allowed. The 2017 cap was set at 50,000 people, compared to 85,000 designated by President Barack Obama for 2016.  In a nod to certain states and cities that have objected to refugee resettlement, the order also seeks to give state and local jurisdictions a role in deciding whether or not to allow people to live there.  COMPLETING THE “BIOMETRIC ENTRY-EXIT TRACKING SYSTEM”  The system is aimed at tracking foreign visitors’ arrival and departure using information like finger prints. Former President Barack Obama’s administration had aimed to start implementing biometric exit checks at the country’s largest airports by 2018.  Some experts have said that for the system to work properly, it would need to cover all land, air, and sea ports of entry, which is a major undertaking. According to a 2014 report from the Bipartisan Policy Center the system would be expensive to implement and would “offer mixed value for enforcement objectives.”  (This version of the story has been refiled to fix spelling of “Iraq” in paragraph 3)  Reporting by Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Tom Hogue",factbox-whats-in-trumps-order-halting-refugee-program.txt,drew.uq

"Mayor Pete Buttigieg was put in the hot seat during the second Democratic presidential debate Thursday when, in the aftermath of an officer-involved shooting in South Bend, Indiana, he was asked: Why is the city’s police force so white? “The police force is 6 percent black in a city that is 26 percent black,” moderator Chuck Todd asked. “Why has that not improved over your two terms as mayor?” “Because I couldn’t get it done,” Buttigieg said. He continued to say that he was “determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle, when they see a police officer approaching, feels the same thing. Not of fear, but of safety. I am going to bring about that very thing.” A South Bend police officer shot and killed 54-year-old black resident Eric Logan on June 16, responding to reports that a man was breaking into cars with a knife. The police officer’s body camera was turned off at the time. Since then, Buttigieg has faced protesters at home as black residents openly questioned whether he cares more about winning the votes of black voters nationwide than he does about fixing the injustices in his city’s public offices. The city is investigating the shooting. On Thursday night, it wasn’t just the debate moderators who had questions for Buttigieg’s handling of racial tensions in his hometown. Several of his competitors on the stage took shots at him as well. At one point, California Rep. Eric Swalwell asked Buttigieg repeatedly why he didn’t fire the current police chief after Logan’s death — a comment that visibly angered Buttigieg. Here’s the exchange: HICKENLOOPER: If I can ask one more question: The question they are asking in South Bend and across the country is why has it taken so long? We had a shooting when I became mayor 10 years before Ferguson. We diversified the police force and ... we did deescalation training. I think the real question that America should be asking is why, five years after Ferguson, every city doesn’t have this level of accountability. BUTTIGIEG: I have to respond to that. We have taken so many steps toward police accountability that the FOP denounced me for too much accountability, and I accept responsibility for that because I’m in charge. SWALWELL: If the camera wasn’t on and that was the policy, you should fire the chief. BUTTIGIEG: So under Indiana law, this will be investigated, and there will be accountability for the officer involved. SWALWELL: But you are the mayor. You should fire the chief — if that’s the policy and someone died. Buttigieg’s handling of outreach to his black constituents has been questioned in South Bend before. In 2012, two months after taking office, Buttigieg fired black Police Chief Darryl Boykins for allegedly taping his white senior officers’ phone calls in an attempt to catch them using racist language, the New York Times reported. Critics argued that Buttigieg, who is white, took the side of white officers who accused Boykins of wrongdoing. He’s replaced Boykins with two white police chiefs. At the time, some in the community called for Buttigieg to be impeached over his handling of the matter, South Bend’s WNDU reported. That said, Buttigieg ran for reelection in 2015 and won with an overwhelming majority — beating the Republican candidate with 80 percent of the vote. Buttigieg’s campaign has been vocal about its attempted outreach with minorities, and its need to better connect with communities of color, with the mayor calling it “one of the most important pieces of homework for our campaign.” The need to do that homework seems to remain; recent polling shows him garnering only 2 percent of black voters’ support. And the recent shooting has only amplified what has been a constant shadow over the mayor’s presidential campaign: his at times strained relationships with communities of color.",democratic-debate-pete-buttigieg-challenged-on-handling-of-south-bend-shooting.txt,drew.uq

"NEW YORK/PASADENA, California (Reuters) - A panel of three appeals court judges in California on Tuesday asked the federal government to defend its decision to end a program protecting from deportation some immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children, who are often referred to as “Dreamers.”  The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals must rule on whether to uphold a lower court’s nationwide injunction ordering the government to keep the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in place while litigation challenging its termination proceeds.  The administration of President Donald Trump announced in September it would scrap the 2012 program launched by former President Barack Obama, and said it was up to Congress to find a legislative solution.  Several plaintiffs, including the University of California, which enrolls many DACA recipients, sued over the administration’s decision, and in January, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco issued the injunction. A judge in Brooklyn, New York, made a similar finding, and a judge in Washington, D.C., gave the government extra time to explain its reasoning.   U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the program was unlawful when he announced the end of DACA, a position the appeals court judges asked attorneys for the government to explain on Tuesday.  Deputy Assistant Attorney General Hashim Mooppan responded that it was within the government’s discretion to decide the fate of the program.  “It is perfectly lawful to have a zero tolerance enforcement policy, but it is potentially unlawful to not enforce the law on a large swath of people,” Mooppan said.  Lawyers for plaintiffs challenging DACA’s termination argued that while Obama was clearly within his rights to establish the program, its end robbed hundreds of thousands of young immigrants of protections they had come to rely on.  Outside the Pasadena courthouse on Tuesday, some 30 DACA supporters gathered in a rose garden, shouting slogans in Spanish and English.  Ali Torabi, 27, a DACA recipient who came from Iran with his mother and younger brother 23 years ago, said he is hoping for a favorable decision from the courts since Congress seems unable to act.  “Both parties are playing a lot of politics with our lives,” Torabi said. “They’ve let us down so many times.”  The panel of judges, all appointed by Democratic presidents, could issue its decision at any time. The Supreme Court, which in February declined a request to weigh in before the appellate court, said at the time it assumed the appeals court would rule swiftly.

"CBL Properties is taking a stand against Black Friday creep. For the second year in a row, the mall operator that manages 62 malls across the country will close all of its locations for the entirety of Thanksgiving Day, according to a letter from its CEO, Stephen Lebovitz. Lebovitz told CNBC that his company had ""such overwhelming support from last year's decision,"" they felt ""validated."" The move is in response to ""Black Friday creep,"" which sees retailers opening earlier and earlier every year on Thanksgiving to capture crowds for ""doorbuster"" sales. CBL is marketing its move with the #makeThanksgivingyours hashtag.

"Democrats have raised millions in the hours since the House passed Trumpcare  Democrats have raised millions in the hours since the House passed Trumpcare  Phones down, wallets out. That was the credo of Democratic “resistance” activists Thursday following the narrow passage of Trumpcare in the House of Representatives despite hundreds of thousands of phone calls and angry town halls denouncing the health care bill. In less than 24 hours, Democrats raised at least $4 million for campaigns and groups challenging Republicans in the 2018 midterms, according to a VICE News analysis of various progressive groups. ActBlue, the fundraising platform used by most progressive groups and the Democratic Party, recorded $4,223,401 in donations Thursday from 123,145 contributors spread across 1,200 different campaigns, organizations, and funds. The DNC said it had its strongest fundraising day since March, and MoveOn.org’s Washington director, Ben Wikler, told VICE News that the fundraising text message sent immediately after the vote was its most successful ever, pulling in over $40,000 (and counting).  At least $2 million went directly to Democratic campaigns challenging Republicans in the House through ActBlue’s “nominee funds,” which save the money for whoever the Democratic nominee ends up being next year. DailyKos, Swing Left, and ActBlue all set up nominee fund accounts yesterday that quickly raised hundreds of thousands of dollars each. Hillary Clinton, who is expected to launch a political PAC next week, also promoted Swing Left’s efforts on Twitter: While many Democrats are now privately nervous that the Republicans could succeed in repealing President Barack Obama’s signature legislative accomplishment, many believe that the vote yesterday could be the key to reclaiming a majority in the House in 2018. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi seemed to almost relish the vote yesterday, warning Republicans, “You have every provision of this bill tattooed on your forehead. You will glow in the dark.”  Phones down, wallets out.

Of the 217 Republicans who voted for the bill, 14 are from districts that Clinton won last November and are top targets for Democrats next year. No issue has galvanized Democrats in the Trump era quite like health care. Tens of thousands have attended Republican town halls, hundreds of thousands have called their representatives. Daily Action, a group born after Election Day that has made calling a congressman’s office easier than ever, tracked over 100,000 calls to congressional offices about health care since February, 43,000 of which were just in the last week. Before the vote yesterday, Daily Action users made 14,506 calls to congressional offices. But the bill passed anyway, and many progressives are realizing the last lobbying option left to them is opening their wallets to help replace the Republicans next year.

"Aretha Franklin sold 75 million records, won 15 Grammy awards, and boasted a range that few other singers had before she died this week at 76 years old. Franklin's legacy—her openness about female sexuality, her embodiment of soul and R&B, and her steadfast dedication to her art—has influenced thousands of artists who have come after her, from Alicia Keys to Ariana Grande. Franklin was originally from Memphis, Tennessee. Born into a preacher's family, her earlier years were spent singing gospel music in church. As her career progressed, she became an icon for women of color during the Civil Rights movement, and her hit songs, from ""Respect"" to ""I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Loved You),"" became household staples and American classics, spawning other songs and lyrics inspired by her powerful style. On today's episode, Franklin fan and Tonic editor Rajul Punjabi sat down with Noisey editor-in-chief Eric Sundermann to honor the legendary singer.

"Below is a complete transcript of Donald Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on July 21, 2016. Also see our fact check of Trump's speech. Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. Who would have believed that when we started this journey on June 16, last year, we — I say we because we are a team — would have received almost 14 million votes, the most in the history of the Republican party? And that the Republican Party would get 60 percent more votes than it received eight years ago. Who would have believed it? The Democrats on the other hand, received 20 percent fewer votes than they got four years ago, not so good. Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order. Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country. Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally. Some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon — and I mean very soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored. The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead. It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation. I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore. So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths — the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there. But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else. These are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17% in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore. In the president's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office. The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total of 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources. One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years old and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 grade point average. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law. I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders. What about our economy? Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are now not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely. Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That is 16 years ago. Our trade deficit in goods reached — think of this — our trade deficit is $800 hundred billion dollars. Think of that. $800 billion last year alone. We will fix that. The budget is no better. President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in third world condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps. Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing. It will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when President Obama drew a red line in Syria and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing. In Libya, our consulate, the symbol of American prestige around the globe was brought down in flames. America is far less safe and the world is far less stable than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy. I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment, something pointed out by Bernie Sanders are what caused the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record. In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq had seen a big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region and the entire world. Libya is in ruins, and our ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim Brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West. After 15 years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: Death, destruction and terrorism and weakness. But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now — poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad — will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you for action for America. The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America first. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America first, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. The respect that we deserve. The American people will come first once again. First, my plan will begin with safety at home which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America. A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me. It is for their benefit. For their benefit. Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change. Never ever. My message is that things have to change and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that had been ignored, neglected and abandoned. I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country, and they are forgotten, but they will not be forgotten long. These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice. I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice. No tolerance for government incompetence. When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws, or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash I am not able to look the other way. And I won't look the other way. And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no no consequence — I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country. When the FBI director says that the Secretary of State was ""extremely careless"" and ""negligent"" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes. In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it, especially when others who have been far less have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come. I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders. He never had a chance. But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: Trade deals that strip our country of jobs and the distribution of wealth in the country. Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for each and every American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy. We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job. The first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their — our communities. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee. On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate. The irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment than frankly, I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seeing. This administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember, it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them in every way and on every single level. When I am president, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally. Every action I take, I will ask myself: Does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, and Ferguson who have really come in every way, have the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats from outside the country. We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS. And we are going to defeat them bad. Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over. At the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many other locations. Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community. No good. And we're going to stop it. As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me. And I have to say as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you. To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. We must have the best, absolutely the best, gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. The best. We must abandon the failed policy of nation- building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, in Egypt, and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast. This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the state of Israel. Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete. Because it did not properly cover terror. And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism. A true step in the right direction. Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country. My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase — think of this, this is not believable, but this is what is happening — a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of president Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be. Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people. On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders, which we can solve. We have to solve it. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protect them and none too protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Believe me. Instead, my opponent wants sanctuary cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Is so sad to even be talking about this. We can solve it so quickly. Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate. We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, immigration system. By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It will not be happening very much anymore. Believe me. Peace will be restored by enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve. Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied and every politician who has denied them to listen very closely to the words I am about to say: On on January 20 of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Which is what we have now. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from the tremendous cycle of poverty they are going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class. I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat — of which there are many. It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office. I have made billions of dollars in business making deals. Now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the greatest businesspeople of the world, I'm going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by bill and Hillary Clinton. Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country. Or frankly, any other country. Never ever again. I am going to bring our jobs back our jobs to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore. My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the world trade organization. Another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters. She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She she supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership which will not only destroy our manufacturing but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it is not going to happen. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and Independence. We will never ever sign bad trade deals. America first again. American first. Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions with many countries that are thousands of pages long and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country that cheats. This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about, they are the greatest currently manipulators ever. Our horrible trade agreements with China, and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America and will walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal. Our country is going to start building and making things again. Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. I mean everyone. America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me. It will happen and it will happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end and it very quickly. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business. That will never happen with Donald J trump as president. Our steelworkers and are miners are going back to work again. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans. We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of our tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children. That is what she is doing and that is what she has done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports, which is a total disaster. Thank you. We are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives. Tremendous problems. We will completely rebuild our depleted military. And the countries that we protecting at a massive cost to us will be asked to pay their fair share. We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released 10 point plan has received tremendous better support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in a line and dying. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal, one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every department head and government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about this for years, but I'm going to do it. We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our constitution. The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views, principles and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association. And will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe. At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community because, I will tell you what, the support they have given me — and I'm not sure I totally deserve it — has been so amazing. And has been such a big reason I'm here tonight. They have much to contribute to our policies. Yet our laws prevent you from speaking your mind from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away. I will work hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things and so much more. All we need to do is start believing in ourselves a in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: You will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job? My dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this tonight. It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people. Then there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great, great judge of character. She could pick them out from anywhere. To my sisters, Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love. You are most special to me. I have loved my life in business. But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country, to go to work for you. It is time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past. America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics. Remember: All of the people telling you you can't have the country you want, are the same people, that would not stand, I mean they said Trump does not have a chance of being here tonight, not a chance, the same people. We love defeating those people, don't we? Love it. No longer can we rely on those same people. In the media and politics who, will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to believe in America. History is watching us now. It's we don't have much time. We don't have much time. It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I am asking for your support tonight so that I can be year champion in the White House. And I will be a champion.Your champion. My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: ""I'm with her."" I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: ""I'm with you the American people."" I am your voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you. To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise: We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again! God bless you and goodnight! I love you!",full-transcript-of-donald-trumps-acceptance-speech-at-the-rnc.txt,drew.uq
"R. Kelly failed to successfully lure a young woman into his life, despite giving her cash and promising to jump-start her career ... and the woman says she has her mom to thank. The woman tells us she met the singer backstage at one of his shows in December after getting a wristband from someone in his crew. She was 20 at the time. She says R. Kelly gave her his number and the 2 exchanged calls and texts, and he promised to help her become an actress/model. He invited her to his Georgia home and told her to ""wear something sexy."" She claims she brought a friend, but it got real creepy -- no phones were allowed and suddenly she was escorted to R's bedroom. The woman says Kelly asked her to strut around and pose like a model ... and convinced her to take sexy photos. She says he paid her $200 when she left and told her to use it to buy black lingerie, heels and red lipstick for her next visit ... which she did. We're told she went back to R. Kelly's place 2 more times -- alone -- but each time he got more aggressive and controlling ... even guilting her into posing nude. She says they never had sex. She says the last straw was him sending her a one-way ticket to be with him back in L.A. in February, warning her not to bring a friend. She says she felt uneasy and told her mother, who promptly put the kibosh on the trip. We reached out to R.

"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The Los Angeles Dodgers, playing with their backs against the wall for the first time all year, sprang back to life with a five-run ninth inning on Saturday to beat the Houston Astros 6-2 and level the World Series at two games apiece.  With Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw set to take the mound for Sunday’s pivotal Game Five in Houston, the best team in baseball all season are suddenly back on track in their quest for a first World Series title since 1988.  “It’s now a three-game series, and we’ve got our ace going tomorrow. So I know that in our clubhouse we feel good,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.  The Dodgers, who breezed through regular season and into World Series, were staring at a potential 3-1 series deficit until Cody Bellinger’s bat came alive when he doubled and scored the tying run in the seventh inning.  Bellinger, who had been hitless in his previous 13 plate appearances, then put the Dodgers ahead in the ninth with a run-scoring double as part of a five-run inning that was capped by Joc Pederson’s three-run blast.  “We’ve been doing it all year. We’re a super resilient team,” said Bellinger, whose Dodgers are now guaranteed to host a Game Six on Tuesday. “Taking one here to make sure we go back to LA is huge.”  The game had been a tight affair as both teams got stellar outings from their starting pitchers.  Dodgers left-hander Alex Wood was working on a no-hitter when George Springer opened the scoring with a two-out homer in the sixth that ended the pitcher’s night. The Dodgers responded an inning later when a Logan Forsythe scored single Bellinger.  “I was glad to keep us in it long enough to where our bats came alive. That felt like us there those last few innings,”  said Wood. “It’s a big win for us. We’ve got our guy going tomorrow, so we’re excited to be able to take it back to LA, too.”  Houston’s Charlie Morgan was nearly as impressive as he allowed just three hits in 6-1/3 innings.  The Astros sent closer Ken Giles out for the ninth and he  promptly allowed a single to Corey Seager, a walk to Justin Turner before Bellinger put the Dodgers ahead.  “He hadn’t faced those guys a ton, but they didn’t have good swings against him in LA,” Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Giles. “One ground-ball base hit to start the inning and things sort of sped up on him a little bit, the walk after that.”  With the Astros down to their final strike, Alex Bregman homered to left but it proved too little too late as Houston’s unbeaten home stretch in the postseason ended at seven games.  Game Five of the best-of-seven World Series is scheduled for Sunday in Houston where the Astros will send Dallas Keuchel to the mound against Kershaw in a battle of left-handed former Cy Young Award winners.

"Despite a great night in House elections, Democrats have lost ground in the Senate. Depending on what happens in Florida and Arizona, the party will hold anywhere between 46 and 48 seats in the US Senate. Any of those options represents a net loss for the party, which currently holds 49 seats. That’s bad enough for the party in the near term. But it’s worse in the medium run. This year’s losses mean that Democrats will have a very hard time retaking the Senate in 2020. Before the election, FiveThirtyEight’s Nathaniel Rakich noted that with a 52-48 Senate in Republicans’ favor, Democrats in 2020 would need to hold on to Doug Jones’s seat in Alabama, defeat both Susan Collins in Maine and Cory Gardner in Colorado, and pick up a seat in a red state by ousting at least one of Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Jon Kyl in Arizona (who’s not seeking reelection), or David Perdue in Georgia. (They’d need one less if they also take the presidency.) In the worst-case scenario for Democrats, a 54-46 Senate, they’d need to flip five seats and hold on to Alabama. A likely path might involve flipping Maine, Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa, and Arizona, in a year that’s not likely to be as Democratic-leaning as 2018. And that’s assuming that Jones holds on in Alabama, as do New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen, Virginia’s Mark Warner, and Michigan’s Gary Peters. Some of them are likely to hold on, but Jones at least is likely to fall, and Shaheen and Warner came close in 2014. Putting it all together, a Democratic flip sounds unlikely. The upshot is clear: Democrats will probably remain in the minority in the Senate until at least 2022. That failure will have grave consequences not just for the prospects of future progressive legislation, like Medicare-for-all or action on climate change, but also for the next few decades of the federal judiciary. The primary consequence of Democrats’ failure in the Senate, in the near term, is that they’ll be unable to stop President Trump’s judicial appointments. They’ll have fewer votes to resist with than they did for Brett Kavanaugh. That could help Republicans solidify or expand their dominance on the Supreme Court. Clarence Thomas is relatively young (only 70), and he could time his retirement for next year or 2020 to ensure a Republican president and Senate determine his successor. And while Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85 and a two-time cancer survivor, and Stephen Breyer, 80, are unlikely to retire under Trump, Democrats should pray for their continued good health, especially given news that Ginsburg fell, broke three ribs, and was admitted to George Washington University Hospital on Thursday morning. Then there are the lower courts. There are currently 122 vacancies on district courts and circuit courts of appeals for Trump to fill, out of 856 total. As analysis from the team at Ballotpedia shows, the aging of the federal judiciary means that by the end of 2020, slightly more than half of district and appeals court judgeships will be a) vacant, b) filled by Trump, or c) held by a judge old enough to take senior status and semi-retire, opening up the seat for another judge. Not all of those judges will take senior status, of course. But some will. And regardless of how many do, the core point remains that Trump will have considerable power to use his Republican Senate majority, and the 50-vote threshold that Democrats established for lower-court judgeships in 2013, to move the lower courts solidly to the right over the next two years. That’s the situation for 2019 and 2020. With the Senate mostly out of contention in 2020, the picture only gets worse for Democrats. If a Democrat defeats Trump for reelection in 2020 but Democrats also fail to retake the Senate — an outcome that’s especially likely if Democrats fall down to 46 seats this year after Arizona and Florida are counted — that Democratic president would not be able to enact much of any legislation of consequence in her first two years in office. Given her likely losses in the 2022 midterms, it’s unlikely she’d be able to pass major bills for her whole first term. Trump broke the trend due to a highly favorable map, but generally, it’s rare for the president’s party to gain seats in the Senate during a midterm. The last time it happened was 2002, in the wake of 9/11, and the last time before that was 1970. So don’t expect President Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders to pass a Medicare-for-all bill, or a job guarantee, or even DC statehood, automatic voter registration, or repairs to the Voting Rights Act. Without control of the Senate in 2021, all those initiatives would be dead in the water. Trump’s hypothetical Democratic successor in 2021 could also be prevented from appointing and confirming any new members of the US Supreme Court. Before the 2016 election, Sens. Ted Cruz, Richard Burr, and John McCain promised that should Hillary Clinton win, they’d favor blocking any and all nominees she put forward for Antonin Scalia’s vacant Supreme Court seat. Unless political polarization and constitutional hardball somehow abates, rather than worsens, by 2021, the Republican caucus is quite likely to adopt a similar strategy then. And if Trump is reelected in 2020, Democratic failure in the Senate would carry graver costs for Democrats. Ginsburg will turn 88 the first year of Trump’s second term, and 92 in 2025, if she decided to wait out Trump. Breyer, who has been in better health but as a man has a lower life expectancy, will be 86 and 90, respectively. It’s also entirely possible that a Trump reelection in 2020 would coincide with a Republican retaking of the House of Representatives. That, combined with a Republican hold on the Senate and Trump’s reelection, would enable new rounds of tax cuts, Medicaid cuts, attempts at Obamacare repeal, and more. Democrats used to rely heavily on seats in red states — not just swing states like Ohio or Iowa, but deep-red states like the Dakotas and Arkansas — for their Senate majority. They don’t anymore, and the Senate map looks increasingly identical to the presidential map. 2016 was the first year in the history of direct Senate elections that every state’s Senate election outcome matched its presidential outcome. That can mean only bad things for Democrats’ viability in the Senate in the medium to long run. Democrats’ losses in 2018 were concentrated overwhelmingly in deep-red states. Republicans flipped Missouri, Indiana, and North Dakota, none of which are normally competitive for Democrats in national elections (flukes like Obama’s 2008 win in Indiana aside), but where Democrats could compete because of popular incumbents from a less polarized age. Similar things happened in 2010 and 2014 in states like Arkansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Louisiana, and Alaska, and the 2010 losses weren’t reversed in 2016; indeed, in most cases, like Arkansas and North Dakota, Democrats didn’t even really try to reverse the losses in 2016. Here’s one way to think about what happened on Tuesday: In January 2005, Democrats had even fewer seats than they’re likely to have in 2019, with only 45. But they had 11 members from states that Mitt Romney would later win. Assuming Democratic losses in Florida and Arizona, Democrats will have only three members from Romney states: Jon Tester in Montana, Joe Manchin in West Virginia, and Doug Jones in Alabama. And Jones is likely to lose in 2020. I’m using Romney states here because he and Obama split up the states pretty evenly (26 for Obama, 24 for Romney), but you can do a similar analysis using Bush/Kerry states, Obama/McCain states, or even Clinton/Trump states, though Senate Democrats’ continued strength in the Midwest changes the latter analysis a bit. The point is, Democrats look increasingly uncompetitive for the Senate in states that aren’t at least purple-ish. That doesn’t necessarily have to doom them for Senate control in the long term. There are enough Republican senators from states that Obama won in 2012 — Marco Rubio, Pat Toomey, Chuck Grassley, Cory Gardner, Susan Collins, Ron Johnson, Rob Portman — such that replacing all of them would enable Democrats to retake the body. But the fact that the Senate map is increasingly resembling the presidential map is bad news for Democrats long-term. The Senate has a profound small-state bias, and small states (and rural states) are likelier to be Republican-leaning than large states; that was even more true before Trump flipped some large Midwestern states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Democrats can win a minority of states and win the presidential popular vote, or even the Electoral College, but they can’t win a minority of states and keep the Senate. Moreover, Democrats would be forced to spend on more expensive races in large states rather than relatively cheap races in places like the Dakotas, where they used to be able to win. It’s not obvious, to me, how Democrats get out of that bind.",midterm-2018-senate-results-democrats-are-unlikely-to-retake-until-2022-or-2024.txt,drew.uq
